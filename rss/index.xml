        <summary>Tim buys a book. Tim accidentally summons a demon. Hilarity, carnage, ensue.</summary>
        <content>&lt;h3&gt;On Demons&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stripped of unnecessary foofaraw—the chanting, the hooded robes, the goat entrails and so on—summoning a demon seems easy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step one: discover a demon’s true name. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step two: say that name out loud. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s it. Now you have an infernal butler.&lt;span class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;Not really. Now you’re being disemboweled by a cranky minion of Hell.&lt;/span&gt; Putting on a condom requires a more extensive diagram. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if really is that easy, everyone’s perfectly-shined shoes would smell of brimstone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact is, demons are almost impossible to summon and anyone who says otherwise is likely sitting on a surplus of hensbane. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Devil is—quite literally—in the details. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until recently, just learning a true name posed a serious obstacle. Demons are keen to keep their true names a secret of course, but the larger problem was simple illiteracy. In the days of the earliest summoners, most people dropped out of school the moment they dropped out of the womb. If someone wanted to learn how to read, they had to agree to celibacy&lt;span class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;Theoretically. Medieval members of the Church had a nuanced understanding of the word “vow.”&lt;/span&gt; and a tonsure for the privilege and then, the only books available tended to be either a Bible or a Bible. Everything else was locked in the priory cellar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was before, though. Things are quite different now, in an age where the Internet can provide page after page of true names, from the lowliest denizen to the very Lords of Hell. And the list of true names extends past Hell and into Heaven. Indeed, the true name of God well known and easy enough to pronounce: YHWH. Some dimwit will tell you that YHWH actually translates either to &lt;em&gt;He Creates&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;I Am&lt;/em&gt;, but it could easily be argued that either is the only possible name for the Almighty. Also, as God is everywhere simultaneously, there is no need to summon Him to the living room like a common denizen; He&amp;#39;s already there.&lt;span class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;If He hasn’t been saying much, it’s probably because He doesn’t like you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that’s step one—getting the name—which leaves us only step two: saying the name. And therein lies the difficultly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bethannal, Lord of the Fifth Pit&amp;#39;s true name is Cik&amp;#39;dasra&amp;#39; Diq&amp;#39; Drisgz&amp;uuml;gatizzyrchs’ Ahrhch’ &amp;Ograve;ehp &amp;#39;Caxxcuxst. This has been known for thousands of years but Bethannal has never been summoned by a mortal and probably never will be, because that string of gibberish looks more like a keyboard seizure than a sound human lips might make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most summonings are accidental. A man nailing some sheet metal to the roof of his hut hits his thumb with a hammer and the interplay of the his feet on the sheet metal as he hops up and down with his florid cursing in Urdu summons a couple of hellflies. Or a woman, demonstrating the a malfunctioning garbage disposal for her landlord, trips over a Pomeranian, knocks over a wine rack and suddenly there’s a greater succubus in the kitchen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the difficulty of summoning a demon, what is an aspiring summoner to do? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, there is another way. Though it is foolish and nearly always fatal, one can get help from the infernal realm itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accident and folly. That’s how a demon gets summoned. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So begins begins the story of Timothy Martin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;On Timothy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When he summoned his first demon, Timothy was a twenty-four-year-old short order cook from Akron, Ohio. Despite later embellishments—mostly circulated by Timothy himself—he was not an impressive specimen. In all things actuarial or demographical Timothy inhabited the losing tail of the American bell curve. He was of low-average height, fatish, oily about the T-zone, small of genitals, nearsighted and actually dumb enough to think he might be smart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About a three-and-a-half out of ten gene-propagation wise. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Timothy was also a geek. Which is fine. Good even, as he happened to be born into one of those rare periods of history where the geeks temporarily inherit the mainstream and therefore the Earth. Unfortunately for Timothy, his particular patch of geekdom was not computers or math—which could have led to lucrative employment—nor was it comic books—useful at least for reminding confused girlfriends/boyfriends who the blue fellow is during a midnight showing of &lt;em&gt;X-Men&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, Timothy’s affliction was not useful, nor was it broadly accepted. Or terribly specific. For lack of an exact appellation Timothy was a hippie or a pagan or an elf. A historical reenactor. A tapestry fancier. A mystic seeker. A horoscope composer. A believer in fairies, a LARPer, a writer of cringe-inducing poetry written in Elvish, a wearer of tights and of fey little boots. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As is often the case with people of this broad type, Timothy also collected objects of the occult. It started with the usual gateway drugs—&lt;em&gt;The Hobbit&lt;/em&gt; and maybe some RenFest on the the weekends—but then he got a taste of the harder stuff—pewter unicorns—and soon  he had a full on howling-wolf teeshirt habit.  What portion of his paycheck remained after food and rent generally went to crystals, candles molded into skull shapes, genuine recreation ritual daggers, wands, supposed palantír, tinctures in little glass bottles, drinking horns, authentic leather breaches and so on. Books were his real weakness though. He had several thousand, on subjects ranging from spriggan habitats to improving sexual potency though the power of the equinox. Some of these books were ancient holy texts while others involved many-sided dice before one could know if the Mind Flayer had successfully enslaved the halfling. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frequently, Timothy would mutter spells from those books while sitting at his his desk, his finger moving slowly down the page. He didn’t really believe magic worked. But he completely believed magic worked. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And he was right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be obvious by now that Timothy was both desperately unhappy and only apathetically tacked to his sanity, a trait he had in common with the greatest necromancers, infernologers, and golem smiths down through the ages. Indeed, allowing for some details, Timothy’s early life almost mirrored that of Rasputin except that he lacked the mad monk’s intelligence, charm and breathtaking facial hair. Timothy’s career would also be somewhat shorter and less spectacular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Book&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first link in the chain that would ultimately bind Timothy to his destiny was forged when he decided to stop by Fancy&amp;#39;s Fancy one day after his shift at the Denny&amp;#39;s Restaurant where he worked. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fancy&amp;#39;s was either a New Age bookstore that happened to stock an extensive selection of pornographic videos in the back room or a porn store lurking behind a selection of dried herbs and moon charts like some sort commercial antlion. The later seems more likely, as hippie nonsense alone likely does not mortgage pay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Henry, the man who ran the bookstore-cum-porn&lt;span class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;I regret nothing&lt;/span&gt; shop, waved at Timothy as he entered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Evening,” Henry said as Timothy entered, “Look like it’s going to snow again our there again?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sure,” Timothy said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Got a bunch of new ones for you,” Henry said, gesturing to a heap of books on the floor next to the counter. “Got them at an estate sale just this morning. Good stuff, I think.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Okay, cool,” Timothy said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As he went sniffing around the pile, Timothy immediately noticed a some of the books had pentagrams on their covers. Interest piqued, he burrowed deeper into pile and then, as if fated, his hand emerged clutching a plain brown tome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Know anything about this one?” Timothy said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under casual inspection the book seemed unremarkable. It was bound in brown leather&lt;span class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;The leather had been cured from the skins of a pair of fraternal twins, a girl and a boy, both twelve year old and of virgin blood pure, sacrificed by the non-light of the year’s first new moon. This sort of thing had absolutely no effect on the contents or power of the book, but some beings still appreciate quality for quality’s sake.&lt;/span&gt;, but not ostentatiously. It was not thick, nor was it thin. It had no smell at all, not the exciting, bland tang of a new book, nor the musty, earthy musk of an old book. Almost anything could have resided between those covers, but even in that first moment, Henry didn’t like the look of it. He didn’t like the lines of its spine. He didn’t like the color of its cover. The whole thing was offensive somehow, distressing like an Escher painting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What’s the title?” Henry said, apprehensively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Don’t know. Doesn’t say on the cover or the spine.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Huh. Well, what’s it look like inside?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Timothy flipped through the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s not in English.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Timothy carried the tome over and set it on Henry’s counter, open to a page somewhere in the middle. Henry nearly told Timothy to get the hell away from him with that thing, but he didn’t. Instead, he took a closer look. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Looks Arabic,” Henry said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, I think it does,” Timothy said.&lt;span class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;Here is a list of all the words and phrases Timothy knew in a foreign language: &lt;em&gt;huevo, tocino, llegaste tarde, se quema&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;idiota&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from a certain crawliness to the characters, the writing inside that book looked nothing at all like Arabic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hey, look at these,” Henry said, turning the book to an illustration that covered a two-page spread. It was a medieval woodcut of a skeleton playing a flute while a city—with all of its screaming inhabitants—burned in the background.&lt;span class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;The skeleton was the Plague. Not infected fleas riding around on Norwegian rats, but the Plague, a demon, the spiritual embodiment of death-by-buboes. Plague&amp;#39;s true name sounds like a soft, whistling fart, making it one of the few demons a person can summon rectally. Several have, to medieval Europe’s dismay.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Wow,” Timothy said, flipping through a few pages, stopping on another woodcut of a turtle with crab legs and a pair of bat wings stomping on naked human forms.&lt;span class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;The aforementioned Cik&amp;#39;dasra&amp;#39; Diq&amp;#39; Drisgz&amp;uuml;gatizzyrchs’ Ahrhch’ &amp;Ograve;ehp &amp;#39;Caxxcuxst doing what she does best.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, it was exactly the sort of book Timothy couldn’t resist. But to be fair, it was a book &lt;em&gt;no one&lt;/em&gt; could really resist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“How much do you want for it?” Timothy said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mostly, Henry wanted to get rid of the book. That feeling of wrongness had grown. Still, he wouldn’t let a little unease stand in the way of wringing Timothy’s wallet like a dishrag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Fifty bucks. Might be worth more than that, but I ain&amp;#39;t had it appraised and since you&amp;#39;re my favorite customer...”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sold,” Timothy said, thinking of how he could use the book as a prop for a priest costume he was going to put together for next year’s RenFest. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Timothy handed over the money, realized he still had a few bucks to spend and picked up a pornographic DVD from the bargain bin. Henry put Timothy’s purchases in a bag and handed it over with a smile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now is probably a good time to step out of the narrative for a moment and discuss the book in that bag, lying innocently enough next to the pornographic DVD. The book had no title. More specifically, it had no name. It wasn’t even a book, really. What Timothy had purchased was a knotted inversion, an irreducible particle. A describer of reality. As such, it was impossible for the thing to have a name, the same way its impossible to spell the letter ‘G’.&lt;span class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;The pornographic DVD was titled Barnyard Sluts Go Butt-Fuck Nuts, making it the single most embarrassingly named object in all the known planes, higher or lower. This is a strange convergence of chance, considering the nature of its bag-mate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nameless or not, the book was one of the most dangerous objects to be found anywhere on Earth, for it contained on its pages the true names of a thousand denizens, creatures of the Pit both big and small. That alone didn’t mean much, as we’ve already discussed, but in addition to containing true names, the book itself possessed a sort of awareness and if it chose, it could whisper the correct pronunciations into the summoner’s ear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That object, that so-called book, held the words that would be spoken on the eve of Armageddon to bring forth the Horsemen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Timothy Martin was not the ideal steward for such an object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;A Demon Appears&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back home, Timothy climbed up to his third floor apartment and let himself in. His roommates, a pair of useless, never-employed hairbags, were sitting on the couch, playing video games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hey dude,” one of them said. His name was Sling, or so he called himself, mostly out of embarrassment that he wasn’t smart enough to bear the proud, nebbish name Herbert Richard Tower-Singleton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, hey,” the other said. This was Chris, who, unlike his roommates, usually had a girlfriend or two. Most of his success in this regard could be attributed to two things: he had long, stringy rockstar hair and he could play &lt;em&gt;Rivers of Babylon&lt;/em&gt; on the guitar well enough to maintain the illusion his hair projected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Guys, damnit,” Timothy said, by way of greeting. “I told you to put those pizza boxes in the trash.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The apartment looked like a consignment shop carpeted sporadically in pizza boxes. What few decorations they possessed tended towards posters of girls in short-shorts twined around gigantic beer bottles.&lt;span class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;Girls who would likely marry rich or divorce second-hand gonorrhea, but never spare a glance for the roommates.&lt;/span&gt; Under the pizza boxes lurked a carpet so thoroughly stained in bong water and worse that the boxes were actually an improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’ll get to it, man,” Sling said. Except to take a single piss, Sling had not left the couch for going on six hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Whatever,” Timothy muttered and made his way towards his room at the very back of the apartment. He set the bag, containing the book and the pornographic DVD on his desk and began to undress for a shower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exactly two minutes and forty-nine seconds later, Timothy sprinted through the living room stark naked and screaming like a veal-calf on the last day of its incarceration. Riding on top of his head was a small, pitch-black bucket imp clutching it’s bucket with one hand and Timothy’s hair with the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again we must step back. What is a bucket imp? How did one come to be jockeying Timothy like a grandstanding rodeo cowboy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hell is a complicated place that requires a great deal of upkeep, but The Lords of the Pit are old-fashioned beings with little interest in automation. Rather than relying on trucks and conveyor belts and steam shovels to get things done, Hell is run like a Medieval serfdom and there is a great deal of manual labor involved. One of the bigger jobs is moving liquids and semi-liquids from one place to another; Hell has lakes, actual lakes, of bile, shit, brimstone, magma, sulfur, tears, digestive juices and boreworm semen that need to be moved from one place to another, for one purpose or another, and all that moving falls to brigades of bucket imps. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The imps are only six inches tall on average and humanoid in shape, though they possess a tail and a pair of oversized horns, relative to their tiny bodies. These distinguishing marks aside, the thing that most defines a bucket imp is their tendency to lose track of one or more of their axis. That is, they can have height, width and depth, but rarely all three at the same time. Also, they’re not much bothered by gravity and float wherever they please. Physics is unhappy about bucket imps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technically, bucket imps aren’t really even demons; they’re stitched together from the remnants of damned souls, though those souls are so processed and modified that bucket imps are made of sinners the way a wiffleball is made of apatosauruses. To the layman a bucket imp looks, acts and smells like a real demon, only on a small scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are, like everything else in Hell, more than a little ornery. It takes a full squad of whip damei to motivate one brigade of bucket imps and a full dozen gate lords (who aren’t really lords, but merely middle-management) to oversee one squad of bucket imps, all to perform a job that humans can accomplish with a sump pump. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It isn’t angels or the forces of good keeping Hell at bay, but rather Hell’s own bureaucracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, poor Timothy had no intention of summoning a demon. He had merely taken off his clothes for a shower, stopped by the book on his way into the bathroom and flipped to a page that had a picture of a woman with horns having sex with a knight.&lt;span class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;A succubus and, technically, she was &lt;em&gt;eating&lt;/em&gt; the knight.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smiling, Timothy touched the horned woman’s little woodcut breasts and then let his finger slide over onto the text next to her. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“********” Timothy said softly, surprised by how good it felt to say those strange syllables, how perfectly they formed up in his mind, how dexterous his tongue felt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be noted, in the interest of science, that Timothy was was idly yanking on his flaccid pud as he spoke the syllables, a fact which may or may not have had some impact on what happened next. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the last sigh of air had passed Timothy’s lips, the bucket imp appeared in front of him. While major denizens will mark their arrival on the mortal plane with smoke, sulfuric odors, lightning crashes, torrents of blood, vistas of the fields of Hell, etc, peons like the bucket imps simply appear. Sometimes there is a small ‘pop’ noise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two looked at each other for a moment. Then the imp lunged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now you’re all caught up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Cook Vs. Janitor&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Timothy’s terrified sprint through the apartment ended abruptly when a pizza box slipped out from under his heel, sending him careening into the kitchenette, where he landed flat on his back.&lt;span class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;You might assume from his earlier outburst over the pizza boxes that Timothy was a fastidious housekeeper, but he wasn’t. He merely disliked the square, grease-stained shapes of the pizza boxes. They reminded him of manta rays, those strange, flat fish often found in the petting pool at aquariums. Manta rays in turn reminded him of inflatable mattresses, which brought back memories of bed-wetting. Well not go further down this particular rabbit hole.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bucket imp detached itself well before Timothy’s crash and remained in the air above him, bobbing gently like a balloon on a string.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sling and Chris stared at bucket imp floating above Timothy with the all the intensity of two drowsy hedgehogs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The fuck?” Chris muttered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Get the book!” Timothy hollered. His extensive education in the supposed dark arts had taught him nothing of any use whatsoever in this particular situation, save one universal truth of demonology: far more important than the ritual to bring forth a demon is the ritual to put it away again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What is that?” Sling said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Get the boooooooook,” Timothy wailed. He was trying to stand up, but every time he made a move, the bucket imp snarled and lunged in horns-first, which caused Timothy to fall back and flail his limbs like an infant on a changing table. His antics made the imp giggle, which was a horrible, nerves-combed-with-needles sort of sound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chris peeled himself off the couch and took a few steps towards the imp, holding out a hand like he was approaching a strange dog. The imp hurled its little bucket, hitting the curious hairbag directly on the snout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Owww, shit,” Chris said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The imp zoomed down to catch the bucket on the rebound and then launched a second attack, this time striking him on the forehead. Again, the imp neatly retrieved its projectile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Get the book!” Timothy screamed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What book, dude?” Sling said. Now he was off the couch and making short lunges in various directions, only lacking something to lunge at or away from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chris, mustering a heretofore unknown reserve of courage, grabbed the first object he could lay hands on and took a swing at the bucket imp. That object turned out to be a wok lid sitting on the counter and it hit the imp with a musical bong. The creature bounced against the wall with more force than its two-dimensional form would suggest. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a common misconception that bucket imps don’t feel pain.&lt;span class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;Pain is a schizophrenic Lord of Hell with many, many personalities and each of those personalities has its own unique name, none of which can be spoken; they must be drawn. Regardless, Pain is still the most often summoned demon in all Hell. Any scab, lesion, cut, blisters, burn, disembowelment or dismemberment will inevitably spell out one of Pain’s many names.&lt;/span&gt; They do. Down in the Infernal Realms, pain is so ubiquitous that the imp had been shocked momentarily senseless by pain’s &lt;em&gt;absence&lt;/em&gt; upon its arrival in the hairbag plane. Imagine jumping into an icy mountain stream, only in reverse. So really, a wok lid to the face went a long way towards making the imp feel more at home. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a snarl, the imp lunged at Sling, clanging bucket against wok lid, filling the apartment with an unholy din. The other two housemates took up battle as well, Sling armed with a cushion from the couch and Timothy slap-fighting fearsomely, which looked something like a starveling chicken trying to escape a washing machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Trap it in the bathroom,” Timothy said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through bulk and adrenal-induced berserkerism, the boys managed to push the imp down the hallway. It bobbed and darted in front of them, never touching the ground, lashing its tail like an angry cat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Timothy managed to throw open the bathroom door. With a roar, Sling batted it past the entryway with the wok lid. Chris threw the pillow and in the instant the little creature dodged back out of the way, Timothy slammed the door, sealing it inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hey, Tim?” Sling said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yeah?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s in our bathroom?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’m not sure, I’m not sure,” Timothy whined, leaning against the wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Oh,” Sling said, considering this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The boys spent a moment trying to regain their breath. The battle of the hallway had been more exercise than they’d had in maybe a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hey, Tim?” Sling said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Why are you naked?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Timothy gazed down upon his nudity. Than a bang from the other side of the door startled him out of his cock-reverie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We gotta get that book,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What book are you talking about?” Sling said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You gotta get some pants,” Chris said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Fuck pants. We need the book.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Pants,” Chris insisted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Seriously,” Sling agreed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bucket banged against the door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’ll be right back,” Timothy said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The neophyte summoner shambled off at a half run, his pale, flabby-yet-scrawny buttocks jiggling.&lt;span class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;Everyone in Hell is naked, all of the time. This might sound like fun, but the great majority of humanity looks awful naked and even beautiful people aren’t particularly sexy while being flayed alive. Or boiled, buried, eaten, set on fire, etc. Also, the light is never flattering. Heaven is a different story: no one is ever naked and under their robes angels are neuter lumps not unlike Ken and Barbie dolls. They play a lot of bingo in heaven. A lot. Hell sucks by design. Heaven sucks by demographics. Its not too late for a conversion to something better.&lt;/span&gt; When he returned, he was hopping into the pants he had worn at work all day while trying to flip through the book at the same time. This operation failed when he slipped on another pizza box, leaving him sprawled on the floor, somehow hogtied by his black work slacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I told you to pick up those boxes,” Timothy nearly sobbed, regaining his footing and, at long, long last, managing to shove his genitals back into his pants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Fuck the boxes. What is that thing?” Chris demanded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s a demon. I summoned it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You summoned it? Fuck you, man.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s one of these.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He showed the roommates a picture of a bucket imp. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Maybe it’s a bat,” Chris said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We need to send it back,” Timothy said. He started leafing through pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still locked in the bathroom, the imp threw its bucket against the door in a quick, triple beat. &lt;em&gt;Toktoktok&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;The imp wasn&amp;#39;t trapped, exactly. Being n-dimensional, it could have slipped under the door. Congratulations, your eagle eye for detail continuity has not failed you. However, in addition to their physical peculiarities, bucket imps are also remarkably stupid. Like houseflies, they will batter themselves silly against the glass rather than look for a crack to the outside.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There’s a demon in the bathroom?” Sling said, celebrating Christmas on Boxing Day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Here,” Timothy said pointing to a passage. “I think this is it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You think what?” Sling said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is how you unsummon it. I think.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Unsummon it? Dude, there is no way that thing is—&amp;quot; Chris said, but he was cut off when Timothy’s convincing rebuttal hurled its bucket against the door again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Let me see that,” Chris said instead, snatching the book. “These are letters, but the words aren’t even sounds.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s the demon’s name, I think. We just have to say that and then…tell it to go home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That’s it, huh,” Chris said, then muttered “asshole.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A demon. Thats kinda cool,” Sling said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You have to trust me,” Timothy said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No, I don’t,” Chris said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I summoned it. I can unsummon it,” Timothy said with some conviction.&lt;span class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;This hilariously untrue statement is very often a summoners last.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toktoktok&lt;/em&gt;, the imp interjected with it’s bucket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I need you to open the door and push it back long enough for me to say the words.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Demon. Okay. Fuck it,” Chris said. He took a deep breath and then, with a shout, he pushed the door open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Situation Gets Worse&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The imp was hovering over at the toilet, busily bailing the water out of the bowl and onto the floor. It was nervous and bailing soothes a nervous imp. Lost in its familiar task, the little shadow just looked at the boys and blinked its yellow eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Splash&lt;/em&gt;, said the bucket, tipping about about a quarter of a cup of water onto the floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“********,” Timothy intoned, book open in one hand, other arm raised theatrically. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another bucket imp promptly appeared just behind his left ear.&lt;span class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;The phrase Timothy kept reading wasn’t actually a name. Bucket imps don’t &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; names. The phrase was actually something like “I call forth the next imp in the queue.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Timothy shrieked and batted at the newcomer with the book. The imp hissed and flitted away but Timothy, with help from Chris, managed to push this new visitor into the bathroom. Unfortunately, somewhere in the melee, Tim actually threw the book at the imp and then Chris slammed the door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“See? I told you I can summon them,” Timothy said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Great job, man. Really great job,” Chris said, back against the door. On the other side, the imps hammered for a while and then things went quiet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What are they doing in there?” Sling said, pressing his ear to the door. “I can hear them. Are they talking?”&lt;span class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;They were. Bucket imps gossip like fishmongers wives. An exact translation of this conversation would be tedious; imps have seventy-two words to describe various pitchfork impalings, yet they resort to “big sky eye fire” to describe sunlight and “toilet” was simply beyond their experience. Mostly, they stuck to asinine elevator topics, observational stuff like “there sure isn’t very much magma up here.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We need to call the cops,” Sling said, “for real.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yeah,” Timothy said, “The police are highly trained to handle demons. Like they’d even believe us. No. Were on our own.&lt;span class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;”We’re on our own” could be the demon summoner&amp;#39;s union credo if they had a union, which they do not. Because they all hate each other.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Trained? Like you are?” Chris said, “Sling, go call the cops.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sling&amp;#39;s phone was lost somewhere out in the wilds of the couch cushions, but he eventually returned, already on the line with the police.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yeah. Something in the bathroom. I don&amp;#39;t know what. Uh huh. Maybe uhh…”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sling looked at Chris for help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A dog,” Chris mouthed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, maybe its a dog. Maybe,” Chris said, “A really big dog. Yeah, it’s a big dog.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A long pause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No, it is an emergency. Animal control is...no. Hey. I didn&amp;#39;t actually see it, okay? It&amp;#39;s really...I don&amp;#39;t know, dude. Maybe its like an escaped tiger?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sling, shut up,” Chris said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’re in the Barton Apartment building. Apartment thirty six.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know. Maybe it came up in the elevator,” Sling said. “No, don’t, look…I”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sling started screaming into the phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Aaaaahh, shit, it’s got out. Oh shit, oh shiiiiittt. Aaaahh! Help!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He ended the call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Well?” Timothy said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“They didn’t want to come,” Sling said, “But they probably will. Thats kinda fucked up. Us calling the cops.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I can definitely hear those things talking in there,” Chris said, pressing an ear to the door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’m gonna go get a shirt, Timothy said. Now that they had guests coming, he was rightfully ashamed of—this colloquialism is crude, but exceedingly apt—ashamed of his bitch-tits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The police, frequent visitors at the Barton Apartments, though usually for noise violations instead of summonings gone astray, appeared only a few minutes later. Chris greeted them at the door while the others remained stationed outside the bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“So you’ve got some kind of animal problem?” the first officer—a white guy—said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yeah. They’re in the bathroom,” Chris said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Any of you been doing a little smoke?” the second cop—a black guy—said, eying the bong prominently displayed on the coffee table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No?” Sling said, really sticking the landing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Dog-tiger in the bathroom, huh? Been seeing any other nasty critters around? Ducklings on the ceiling? Bugs under your skin, maybe?” the black cop said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Christ, Rick,” the white officer said, “Why not ask them if they’re hopped up on goofballs?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Arrest us later,” Chris said, “Just come see whats in the bathroom first.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Oh yeah. Thats some kind of line,” the black officer said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The police made their way down the hall and took up position outside the bathroom, shooing the housemates out of the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I don’t hear a dog,” the white officer said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I hear something,” the black officer said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What else you three want to tell us before I open this door?” the white officer said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Its not a dog,” Timothy said, “it’s a pair of demons I summoned.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its difficult to know if Timothy told the officers the truth because out of civic responsibility or an urge to boast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Oh. Is that all?” the white officer said and opened the door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two thousand, three hundred, thirty two bucket imps burst out of the bathroom in a rush of shadow and glowing yellow eyes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Words like malevolent cloud or wicked horde might describe the scene, but tempting as that kind of dramatic language is, the imps probably don’t merit such grandiosity. Lets just call it a flock. Like seagulls. Similar to seagulls making a mass-takeoff down the beach, it was impossible to pick any one individual imp from the collective. Shrieking and giggling like schoolgirls at a slumber party, the imps rolled out into the hall, swinging their buckets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a little-known fact that demons can summon other demons and do so frequently. The whole power structure of Hell depends on it. Satan summons his Lords, his Lords summon lieutenants, the lieutenants summon their overseers, the overseers summon their assorted worker-imps and, bobsyeruncle, the Center for Infernal Justice gets a new Flaming Sodomy Annex. Bucket imps, residing as they do at the very base of Hells phone tree, have very limited authority, but they are capable of summoning one specific denizen: each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under ordinary circumstances though, imps cannot summon anything at all on the mortal plane. Under ordinary circumstances, imps should never be on the mortal plane. These were not ordinary circumstances though. With the book in play, the imps were capable of summoning almost anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Carnage, Flight&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imps tangled in hair. They stole the white cop’s hat. More crawled under shirts while the general majority amused themselves with non-specific bucket-whackings. The humans careened off each other and the walls, trying to escape in five different directions. Somewhere in the melee, Timothy found himself face-down on the bathroom floor. There, he saw more than a dozen imps still bailing water out of the toilet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the cops—it was impossible to say which, buried as they were in imps—started firing his gun, which did a fantastic job of killing the roommates damage deposit but not much else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Swatting frantically, the roommates managed to fall back into the living room. More gunfire emerged from the hallway. The police retreated to Timothy’s bedroom and there they died. The roommates didn’t see exactly what happened, but the gunfire turned to shouts and then screams and then the screams cut off abruptly, as if a signal had been given. The imps returned to the hallway in a lazy, cheerful cloud. Many carried buckets of blood, full to dripping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Oh fuck. Oooohhh fuck,” Chris said.&lt;span class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;Conventional wisdom has it that when employing any sort of deus ex machina, one should introduce the device well before the story requires saving. That said, we will now make the acquaintance of Timothy&amp;#39;s car, so that you wont find its sudden appearance later at all jarring. Indeed, Timothy owned a 1998 Geo Metro hatchback, a crumple-fendered, three-cylinder admission of failure. So there, now you know, while still safely within act two, of the plot device necessary to the conclusion of act three. Full disclosure also requires us to admit that Timothy&amp;#39;s pornographic DVD, introduced conspicuously as a Chekhovian gun in act one in fact serves no further role in this narrative. Apologies for any anticipation you might have experienced waiting for its return.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of the apartment. Into the hallway. The roommates tried to close the door, but imps piled in the gap and, working together, they heaved it back open. Free of the apartment, they milled around in momentary confusion. The windowless hallway offered little of interest&lt;span class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;Things imps find interesting: liquids, either running or standing; buckets.&lt;/span&gt; so the imps resumed their chase, squeaking their ridiculous little battle cries as the boys fled before them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waiting on the elevator didn’t seem wise, given the horde of imps, so Chris led them down the stairs, pursued at every step until they burst out the door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was full dark outside now. It was also snowing, big, department store flakes&lt;span class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;likelyhood of snow introduced in the bookstore scene&lt;/span&gt; that fell in delightfully lazy flips and glides under the streetlights, but the roommates, fleeing from a growing legion of Hell, didn’t take time to appreciate the tranquility of the scene. Instead, they ran across the parking lot—past Timothy’s Metro&lt;span class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;Now the car has been mentioned twice, both well in advance of using it for story purposes.&lt;/span&gt;and into the edge of a small city park that abutted the apartment complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The imps, aside from a few listless swings here and there, showed little interest in the humans now that they found themselves loosed upon world were frozen, bailable water fell from the sky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The doors leading back into the apartment had never really closed under the flow of imps, but now it bulged open as a particularly large knot of the little shadows pushed free. This group had something, a brownish something, held aloft between many tiny claws and across a dozen wee backs. It was the book. With it, one of the imps was busy summoning his friends in bulk and the imps not engaged with the summoning were ranging further and further afield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We gotta do something,” Sling said, shifting his weight from foot to foot like he had to urinate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, we do,” Timothy said, with unusual steel in his voice. “And I know what.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Run?” Chris said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Timothy shook his head. He was not wearing shoes or a jacket, but he was wearing his work pants&lt;span class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;A fact prudently mentioned and subtlety emphasized earlier. Deus Ex Machina is a delicate dance of forethought.&lt;/span&gt; and so he had the keys to his car in the front right pocket and his cell phone in the other. He pulled the keys out and tossed them thoughtfully from hand to hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Right,” he said. His voice still carried that note of heroic resolve. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What?” Sling ventured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;They like water, don&amp;#39;t they?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sure?&amp;quot; Chris said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Call the police again. Tell them to bring the National Guard,” Timothy said. He handed his cell phone to Sling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What are you doing?” Sling said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’m going to stall them.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This wasn’t exactly a declaration of war, but it was still pretty good, considering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“And oh,” Timothy said, turning back around, “Get a video of this.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yeah. Okay,” Sling said, turning on the camera function and pointing the phone at Timothy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Heroic Plan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The imps ignored Timothy as he crossed the parking lot. He climbed into the Metro and turned the key. Unfortunately, the Metro had an addled, prima donna of a starter that would only deign to turn the engine over when temperatures were above forty. Now, it made a terrible screech, but that was all. He tried again and got the same screech. Timothy considered the situation. He fastened his seatbelt. He nearly cried. He pounded on the steering wheel and screamed. The other two eventually strolled over, Sling still recording. Chris tapped on the window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Timothy took a breath.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He rolled the window down a crack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I need a push,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“To where?” Sling said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“To get the car started. Get it rolling and I’ll pop start it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Metro weighed about as much as a couch, so Sling and Chris were able to shove it out of the space and then reverse that motion, getting the car headed off generally in the direction of the street and the greater concentration of imps. Timothy waited until the Metro had reached a jogging speed and then he popped the clutch. The car jerked, lagged, nearly died and then puttered awake. Without pause to consider his own considerable cowardice, Timothy and put the pedal to the novelty anime-themed floor mat and the Metro hustled across the lot, across the street, up onto the opposite sidewalk and directly into a fire hydrant, which promptly exploded into a fountain of irresistible, free-running water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Timothy, stunned and bleeding from a gash on his forehead, got out of the car and stumbled across the street before the imps landed en masse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That was sweet, man,” Sling yelled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The imps, formerly wandering off to every point of the compass, about-faced and charged back to the water gushing from the broken hydrant and began bailing with pure glee. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a delaying tactic, it appeared sound, at least for a moment. Unfortunately, there was much Timothy didn’t understand about imp psychology and their instinct to swarm. Prior to the appearance of water, the imp with the book was summoning up his pals as a way to pass the time. Now that something worth bailing had appeared, the imp considered itself back on the clock. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Empowered by the book, it chanted and imps poured forth into the moral realm. Three thousand, a full legion. Two legions. Like Alabama ants in a drought, they swarmed the hydrant, nearly blacking it out with their tiny, squirming bodies. Within a minute, perhaps less, some of the imps had chased the water back into the pipes that delivered it while others ran down every free drop in the gutters while further hordes bailed what had already been bailed. They bailed and bailed, with no direction, but unlimited energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Oh, wow,” Sling said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sirens wailed in the far-off distance, but by the time the police arrived, the street would be filled with imps from gutters to stratosphere. This time, Timothy really might be the world’s last hope. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Hero Does Battle&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Timothy, owner of an AD&amp;amp;D Monster Manual signed by Gygax, wearer of Axe brand spray-on deodorant, knight of Halo, occasional defender of his own dignity and reluctant champion of not one single thing, surveyed the scene. All up and down the street, people appeared in their doorways and peered out of windows. His car had nearly vanished under the imp heap—just its round ass stuck out of the pile—and the horde continued to multiply. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a steadying breath, Timothy stepped off the curb. He took another step. He stripped off his teeshirt and wound it into a rope between his fists. He turned to Chris.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Lighter,” he growled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chris reached into his pocket and produced a Harley-Davidson branded Zippo.&lt;span class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;Which had been carefully designed by a marketing firm in Anaheim, via almost a dozen meetings and three focus groups, to appeal to middle-class America’s idea of macho. It had a picture of a bearded man wearing sunglasses and riding a motorcycle. Behind him was a woman. Only her face was visible over his shoulder, but presumably she wore a bikini and liked to give handjobs in gas station restrooms.&lt;/span&gt; Timothy caught the lighter without ever taking his gaze off the pile of imps and thus armed, he walked across the street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The legions ignored him entirely. He walked right up to the car and even brushed a few of the imps away from the gas-input hole cover.&lt;span class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;It’s strange that a people both blessed with a nuanced language and possessing an oedipal love of their motor vehicles have no word to describe this area of a car.&lt;/span&gt; Still unmolested, he unscrewed the cap, stuck a good length of his twisted-up shirt into the hole and then, under a continuing barrage of indifference from the imps, he painstakingly set the shirt on fire. It took a while, but eventually the flame caught and began to grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Timothy sprinted back to the park and his waiting friends, expecting at any moment to feel an insistent push at his back followed by a wave of heat. Instead, he arrived at the curb out of breath and the three of them turned to watch the Metro’s continued non-explosion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Huh,” Chris said, while Sling recorded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shirt flared yellow for a moment and then seemed to go out. A fresh wave of imps arrived, shifting the geometry of the pile, and the car vanished entirely under the mass of limbs and buckets. The boys watched for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Goddamnit,” Timothy panted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Were you trying to blow up your car?” Chris said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Metro exploded. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any self-respecting revolutionary will tell you that the wick on improvised explosives—Molotov cocktails, Geo Metros—ought to be soaked in something combustible before use. Tee shirts just don’t burn all that well on their own. That Timothy’s idiotic plan worked at all was largely due to an equal idiocy working in the opposite direction. The only person dumber than Odysseus was the Trojan who thought that horse would make a good conversation piece. The idiocy was provided by one of the imps, who, frustrated by its inability to reach the water under its many, many friends, detected some sort of liquid down at the end of a tight, narrow pipe. So the imp wriggled into the hole, down past some sort of smoldering material that it found reassuringly Hell-like, then splashed into something that smelled rather cheerfully nostalgic. Pleased, the imp began bailing, as is the wont of its kind. As it bailed, a few, fine droplets of gasoline went up the pipe, where they met the last, fading ember of Timothy’s charred tee shirt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the little car was busy doing exciting exothermic things with gasoline, several thousand flaming imps went on unexpected journeys into the sky and the resulting fireball blinded the roommates. All up and down the block, lookieloos started screaming while Sling went right on recording.&lt;span class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;This footage—blurry and dark, didn’t serve as incontrovertible proof of demons and thus Hell. Humankind’s entire relationship with the Universe did not change as a result of it and there was no global spiritual awakening unmatched since Christ died on the cross. The footage did keep the roommates out of prison, if only because no jury would be able to decide exactly what was going on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the imps, the explosion was interesting, but completely harmless as it takes a lot more than the contents of one Geo Metro’s stomach to hurt a denizen. In Hell it is considered a little rude to explode someone without cause though, so the flock drew itself back together and then whirled up into an agitated cluster, before spilling across the street like the tide. The boys—and everyone else in the vicinity—would have died then, if another demon not suddenly appeared. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Demon Ex Machina&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was called Tiramok, and she was a lieutenant of Hell. She stood taller as the walls of Babylon, her horns were broad as a river in flood and her claws could impale four men standing front to back. A whispered word from her lips could poison, corrupt and kill. Since the Fall, she had served her master at the center of every battle and whole companies of angels scattered at the sight of her on the horizon. She was aftermath. She was the carrion crow. She was the battle lost. Her name, her true name, was the sound of rain on the ashes of a village swept bare by raiders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, in this case, in the presence of the Book, her name was perfectly pronounced by hydrant water sizzling against the hot roof of a recently-exploded Geo Metro.&lt;span class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;When one commits to a Deus Ex Machina, its best to &lt;em&gt;commit&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tirarmok surveyed the scene with her ghastly, ghostlamp eyes and a seismic growl issued up from her throat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Whodares&lt;/em&gt;?” she said in rather posh demonic.&lt;span class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;A traditional greeting in Hell. If demons had phones, this is how they would answer them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then she saw the imps. And the book. And the humans standing around with expressions on their faces that revealed a complete lack of understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Oh, damnit&lt;/em&gt;,” the demon muttered, with significantly less menace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bucket imps threw themselves prostrate at her cloven feet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tirarmok sighed. Two bursts of flame erupted from her nose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**********, she shouted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another demon appeared at her side. This second demon was quite menacing, but only about the size of a human, with the head of a pig, the torso of an ant and the legs of a ballerina. It carried a long whip coiled over its shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Yes, master?&lt;/em&gt;” the new demon hissed, also in demonic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tirarmok pointed at the worshipful pile of imps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Ha!&lt;/em&gt;,” the new demon said, “&lt;em&gt;How’d they get up here?&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tirarmok bent and picked up the book from where it lay near the Metro. She showed it to the other demon. It was unmarked from its adventures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Oh. That thing. Slippery, slippery,&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“He is going to be so angry,” Tirarmok muttered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s not your fault, is it? You’re not the thing’s keeper,” the other demon said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s so political. I don’t want anything to do with it.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Well, too late for that.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I suppose.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Best get moving.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pig-ant-ballerina turned to the imps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Right, you lot. Hup to.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the crack of an infernal whip, the imps pulled themselves into a raged semblance of a parade rest. A moment later, they all vanished. Tirarmok stood with the book tweezered carefully between her claws and looked up and down the street. Cops were arriving on the scene with their lights flashing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Idiots,” Tirarmok muttered before she too vanished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Metro continued to burn. Official types began their own sort of swarming, setting up barricades and cordoning off the street. Almost unnoticed, the roommates stood in the park lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What just happened?” Sling said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I have no idea,” Chris said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Timothy only smiled. He was a summoner now. Soon, the world would feel his wrath.&lt;span class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;He wasn’t and it wouldn’t.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <summary>Old, embittered and depressed, Eustace decides to kill himself. Then he does something else.</summary>
        <content>&lt;p&gt;Eustace had the gun, a belly full of whiskey, and the moment his television program was over, he would kill himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The program was one of those soap operas about a hospital. On screen, noble doctors scrambled to save a girl on the operating table. There had been an accident. Eustace, stone-deaf and mostly disinterested couldn’t hope to keep pace with the show’s dialog, but that didn’t matter. Cutting someone open. Running around. Crying. Sneaking into the supply closet for a tryst. The doctors on TV inhabited a world filled with motion, whereas Eustace’s world—which was not the real world, but instead something called Lutheran Eldercare—stood silent and still.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the far corner of the room, lying entombed in a state-issued hospital bed, Eustace’s roommate—Joe, by name, comatose by trade—groaned in his sleep and shifted restlessly. Eustace squinted over at the enshrouded form, waiting for the inevitable. Then it came. Joe farted, a low, wet flapper. Only time would tell if he had shit himself again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Stoppit, you son of a bitch!” Eustace growled—nearly sobbed—as the fart started to stink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joe and Eustace had bunked together for a few years now, but Eustace didn’t really know the man, because the man was gone. Joseph Montgomery entertained his last rational thought right around the turn of the century. He could walk and talk some, but mostly he stayed in bed, rotated every once in a while like a pig over a fire to stave off bedsores. That was fine. Eustace preferred a quiet roommate. Unfortunately, Joe, no longer a citizen of Coherent, had little control over the delivery of his mail. The orderlies cleaned him up eventually, but only in their own sweet time. Meanwhile, Eustace got to sit there in a fog of Joe’s guts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the more reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The doctor program went to commercial and Eustace reached surreptitiously under the recliner for the bottle of whiskey. The orderlies didn’t know about the booze and they surely didn’t know he had the gun, or they would have taken both away from him before he could say “God bless Betty Ford.” Keeping quiet. That was the secret here in the Eldercare. Keep quiet and they’ll be happy to ignore you forever. Joe, who had shit himself and in grand fashion, was proof of that; he only complained rectally, and nobody ever bothered him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You stinking son of a bitch!” Eustace yodeled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right after the show. Time to go. Way past time. Eustace glanced at the clock. Ten forty-five in the morning. Another fifteen minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The door to the outside hall stood open and Eustace wanted it that way, so nothing would muffle his final word, but an open door also required prudence. He got the remote and fumbled the television’s volume way down, listening for the squeak of orderly shoe on tile. Satisfied that Ricky or one of his henchmen wasn’t going to walk by, Eustace reached a shriveled paw into the recliner’s elasticized pouch, where the pistol waited. His fingers crawled across the hammer and the barrel and over the dimples of the cylinder. This wasn’t the way he would have chosen, but it would do. He pulled the pistol free and set it in his lap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gun was an Colt Single Action Army, a Peacemaker, once owned by Eustace’s father. An antique and probably valuable, but never once in the seventy-odd years since he had inherited the thing had Eustace considered selling it, even during some hard, hard times. Maybe he’d always known there would be a use for it at the end of a whole stack of decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ten till the hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eustace reached back into the recliner’s pouch for the ammo. The cardboard carton was old and frayed white around the corners, but the blunt rounds inside shone clean and brass-bright. He’d kept the carton dry and cool, first in the back of a closet at home and then wrapped in a ball of his own boxer shorts when they deported him to the Eldercare. The Peacemaker itself wanted for oil, but still operated smoothly enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He pulled the hammer back to half-cock and liked the sound. The gate came open smoothly and he thumbed in the first bullet with a shaking hand. He skipped the next chamber and fed four more rounds to the gun. Never give a Peacemaker the full six rounds. Five was enough. His daddy had taught him that. Eustace dropped the gun back onto his lap and resumed watching television.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joe let fly again, a high, jaunty whistle that should have set the bastard’s bed sheets to flapping. Eustace had long ago dubbed that particular cannonade “the brass band,” as opposed to the subtler, but far nastier “angry crocodile.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh lordy look what he had been reduced to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After what seemed like a hell of a long time, the doctors on finally saved the girl’s life and the credits came up. Staring fixedly at the television, Eustace groped around in his lap until he found the gun. It was heavier than it should be. His chicken arms shook from the effort but the gun stayed where it was. A bank commercial came up, starring a goofy guy in a polo shirt who walked through a mountain meadow while yammering on about home loans and free checking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eustace glared at the television, giving it the same look Joe got for farting. The bank had been where things started going bad. He had wanted to open his own repair shop and the bank had been happy to give him a loan, hadn’t they? Real happy. But when things went sour—this had been in the early sixties—that goddamned bank had come and taken his house. He and Shirley moved into a rented trailer and he had to start working for that prick, Ernie, again. Life never did get back to right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here he was, stuck in this shit-befouled, pauper purgatory where the pills came every three hours and the television only went to sleep when the inmates did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eustace pointed his pistol at the goofy fellow with the polo shirt and the free checking. He pulled the hammer back to full-cock and again he liked the authoritative click it made settling into place. He pulled the trigger. The Peacemaker&amp;#39;s hammer fell on the empty chamber Joe hadn&amp;#39;t loaded with a dry, businesslike snap and he grinned. When they came and took his house away from him, he had stood by docile as a mule and then he’d spent most of his life turning a wrench under someone else’s car for the price of a hamburger or two an hour. He’d done it for the kids, and for Shirley, and that’d been right and maybe he didn’t regret it, exactly, but Shirley was long dead, same deal with his youngest son, the only one of the three that had ever been worth a damn. The other two, both of them old men in their own rights, never called and never wrote and had left him in this place without so much as a fare-thee-well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What did that leave? Nothing, hence the Peacemaker. And it would make peace, Eustace had no doubts on that count.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But a man ought to use what freedom he was allowed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eustace glanced out the door. Still no Ricky. That fatso was probably at the end of the hall, watching television in the orderly station. Eustace checked the wall clock, hanging above some Christmas cards from Joe’s niece and nephew. Just past eleven in the morning. Ricky wouldn’t make his rounds until noon, when it was time to deliver lunch and meds. Eustace sat, fiddling with the gun and waiting for his passing thought to assemble itself into a course of action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, by God. A better way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First things first, he needed to pry himself out of the chair. He positioned each limb just so and then, after an assessment of leverage, weights and air resistance he hoisted himself—carefully!—up, creakingly aware that his hip not only could snap on him, but actually relished the idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually Eustace attained a state of upright and shuffled over to the closet, stripping out of his robe as he went. Underneath, he was buck-assed naked, beyond a pair of socks and his slippers, but if that offended Joe, well, Joe shit himself. On the way across the room, Eustace happened to catch a reflection in the bathroom mirror. His body sagged where it hadn’t mummified. He could see his actual self under that mess though, handsome, with a dimpled chin and a pair of green eyes that used to put the leg-spreading voodoo on the ladies. Or maybe he could only remember remembering that face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the closet, Eustace decided on his suit. He might as well make this a formal occasion. Starting with underwear, working ponderously, he got the suit on (worn only to funerals in recent years) and finished with a red bow tie Shirley used to like. She said he looked natty in it and natty was hunky-dory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dressed, Eustace put his robe back on and wrapped it tight. Ricky and the other orderlies expected their inmates to wear the proper uniform at all times. That Eustace had had his best wingtips on, not to mention a fine wool suit, didn’t matter a tittle, so long as he had the robe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He had to move fast now; if he slowed down, this craziness might drain out of him and that would be a shame. He reached in under the robe and under the jacket of his suit and shoved the gun into the waistband of his pants. It was a stupid way to carry a loaded firearm around—unless he was aiming to blow his balls off—but stupid was the order of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Armed and dressed, Eustace hopped over to the door and grabbed an envelope tacked to the bulletin board next to it. Some MediCare thing his son wanted him to sign. Eustace didn’t know what the papers signified, nor did he care. What mattered is that it had the ungrateful bastard’s return address on the envelope. Eustace shoved the whole wad into his robe pocket and stepped out into the hallway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ricky was indeed at the orderly’s station, watching the television and shoving Cheetos down his gaping, hippo mouth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Morning,” Ricky grunted. He didn’t stand up, but he did take his feet off the desk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eustace nodded, keeping his head down. He wanted to appear good and zombie-like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Going for a walk there, buddy?” Ricky said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sure,” Eustace mumbled, “Stretch my legs.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Don’t get into any trouble.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ricky went back to the television and Eustace continued his hobble down the hallway. Upon opening the front door (Mother Mary, how did something so simple get to be such a struggle?) and stepping out into the late November sunshine, Eustace was struck with that prisoner’s awe at the size of the outside world. His life was spent in hibernation; whole days passed without him moving any further than the bathroom. Now cars zoomed past every-which-way and even the wind struck him as a trifle intimidating. A helicopter flew overhead. Eustace shivered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The corner store, Eustace’s first destination, was a few blocks up from the Eldercare, quite a walk, but he managed, even doffing an imaginary hat to a pretty girl. Despite his being dried Methuselah in a bathrobe, she smiled at him and waved, laughing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bell above the door jangled as Eustace maneuvered into the corner store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Good morning,” the fat woman at the counter said, looking at Eustace’s bathrobe with one eyebrow cocked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Mornin!” Eustace said, beaming. He went over to the counter and pulled a ten dollar bill from the pocket of his robe. The Eldercare received his government check directly, on the assumption he had become too addlebrained to pay the rent on his own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What can I do for you?” the fat woman said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Smokes,” Eustace barked, scanning the shelves myopically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Smokes huh? What kind?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eustace checked his memory. He’d had a brand once, before he’d stopped smoking in…whenever he’d stopped smoking, which had been a long time ago. Sunbeam or Dancer or…hell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Luckies,” he said. They weren’t his brand, but they should have been. Only a man afraid of death would pussyfoot around with filters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Lucky Strike?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Those are them,” Eustace agreed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The clerk found a pack and set it on the counter. It was covered in a light robe of dust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Got some matches, too?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think so. Somewhere.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“How much?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Them cigarettes are four dollars. The matches are free.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Good. Can I get a paper bag?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The clerk produced a tiny bag that was just barely big enough for the deck of smokes. Eustace shook his head. “Bigger bag. Biggest you got.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“How is this?” she said, holding up a full-sized paper grocery bag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Bingo!” Eustace said, pulling his lips back from a picket of yellowed, but mostly present, teeth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eustace picked up the cigarettes and dropped them into the pocket of his robe along with the matches, then took the empty bag and tucked it under his arm. The clerk raised her eyebrow again, but made change without comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You have a good day,” Eustace said, shuffling to the door. The fat woman watched him go, put the ten dollar bill into her register and gently closed the drawer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside, Eustace veered off into the alley running between the corner store and its nearest neighbor. When he was sure no one could see him, he struggled out of his robe and dropped the filthy old thing on the ground like a shed skin, and then pulled the pistol out of the waistband of his pants. He considered the gun for a moment, before dropping it into the paper bag. He folded the bag over twice, so it made a tidy little package, and tucked it under his arm. The remaining money, the envelope with his son’s address on it and the Luckies went into the breast pocket of his jacket. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a bus stop directly across from the corner store. Eustace hobbled over to the shelter and had himself a seat on the bench. While he waited, he peeled the wrapper off his Luckies and pulled one of the shorter-than-normal cigarettes out, relishing the good, earthy smell of tobacco. There had been a reason he’d quit, but damned if he could remember it. He had a head full of holes like that, places where important information should be, but wasn’t. You got used to it, after a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eustace stuck the cancer stick in his mouth. It took him three tries to strike a match—his hands had a hard time with fine tasks—but when the first, trembling inhalation made the effort worthwhile. He leaned back and watched a pair of sparrows bicker in a winter-bare bush nearby. Scummy gray snow from the storm a few days back lined the gutters, and the sun, while warm against his face, had that peculiar winter hardness to it. He took another long drag, and then blew out. That made him cough for almost a full minute, but by God, it still felt good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He got onto the first bus that happened by. The driver told him to lose the cigarette, which he did, and then Eustace took out his envelope and asked the man how to find the address written thereon. The driver gave him a long explanation, but Eustace didn’t bother paying attention. All that mattered was that he was headed in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two hours and three transfers later, Eustace stepped off a different bus in an unfamiliar neighborhood. Big, new houses squatted on tiny lots like a row of bulldogs all shitting on napkins. His useless elder son was living the American dream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eustace patted himself down (cigarettes: check, bag with pistol: check), pulled the envelope out of his pocket, and started walking. At each house along the street, he shuffled up, peered at the address until it came into reasonable focus, checked the envelope again and then moved on. It took him half an hour to traverse the three blocks between the bus stop and the porch of what he hoped was Useless Son’s house. Useless Son as opposed to Drunken Son or Dead Son.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By then, Eustace was literally panting, his tongue poking over his lower lip like a dried-up tuber. He double-double-checked the envelope. Looked at the numbers by the house’s door. A definite match.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eustace celebrated by sitting on the front step. It was about one in the afternoon, maybe two. He looked up and down the street, wondering at the complete and total stillness. Not so much as a housecat. No sign of life from inside either. Where were Useless Son and the Skinny Harpy? Eustace didn’t know. Useless Son was in the far reaches of sixty by now, and retired, so the little shit didn’t have anywhere in particular to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe he was at the doctor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That gave Eustace a thrill. Maybe Useless Son was discovering that old happened to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or maybe they were inside, peeking out through the blinds while the Harpy called the Eldercare to come collect him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eustace’s heart had resumed its usual wheezing throb and his tongue once again fit into his mouth, where it belonged. He stood and made his way across the yard, towards the garage. It had two big doors, one for each of the two cars it could hold. Those doors would be hopeless. Even if they weren’t locked, Eustace lacked the strength to heft them up. But the garage had a side door, for people, not cars, around the corner. That door was locked. Eustace jiggled the handle, kicked it and even threw a shoulder against the door, trying to batter it down with his scarecrow bulk, but nothing happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Ok. We’ll see. We’ll see,” Eustace said to the door, as he unfolded the paper bag from around the Peacemaker. Squinting and turning his face to the side, as if he were afraid the gun would slap him, Eustace pointed the gun just to the right of the doorknob and slowly squeezed the trigger. A brisk explosion, much louder than Eustace had expected, rolled up and down the street. The recoil staggered him back ten feet, but a hole, roughly the size and shape of a soup can, appeared in the door where the latch had formerly met frame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dogs all around the neighborhood raised an alarm. With the pistol’s kick still clanging his bones together like church bells, Eustace took a quick look at the streets—no cops, at least not yet—and tried the door. This time it swung politely open. Chuckling, Eustace stepped into the garage and laid eyes on his old girl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was a 1950 Mercury Monterrey, yard upon yard of Detroit steel. Not exactly in great shape—faded paint and a hardtop with only a few remaining scraps of vinyl—but doing no worse than Eustace himself. Purchased when he was thirty-seven years old, the car was what they would call a mid-life crisis purchase—or, one-third-of-life crisis, considering Eustace’s collection of years. He’d driven her up until…right around the time the red-faced President (Carter?) got his dick sucked by that fat…actress?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, rather than sell her, Eustace had grudgingly given the Merc over to Useless Son. Every time Useless Son showed up at the Eldercare (which was almost never), Eustace pestered him about the Merc. Keep her in a garage and be sure to give her some exercise now and again. Change the plugs, willya?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, yeah, of course, pops,” Useless Son would say, “I’m taking care of it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eustace half-believed the little fart had gone and sold his girl, but here she was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eustace ran a hand along the Merc’s curved, downward-sloping flank, taking in her crumpled fender and missing chrome. He opened her door and had a look inside, then walked around back and checked the plates. Licensed and everything, with some of those fancy classic car tags. Now it was only a matter of keys. Eustace bowed stiffly at the waist, like an English butler, and, propping himself carefully against the car’s black hide, felt around under the front wheel well, searching for the nifty magnetic hide-a-key key box he’d secreted away all those years ago. After just a few seconds of groping, he found it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Ha!” Eustace cackled, performing a shuffling two-step on the dusty concrete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That left only one minor detail: escape. The garage came equipped with a door-opening gadget, but its operation escaped Eustace. And besides, a more direct solution presented itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gun went back into paper sack. Paper sack went into car, on the passenger side of the bench seat. Then Eustace performed the complicated ritual of folding his antiquarian body into a sitting position behind the Merc’s wheel. From there, he had to stop and take stock. A long time ago, his body had been wired to perform all the actions required to start a car and get it moving, but now each step required conscious thought. Key went into ignition. One foot on the clutch, one on the gas, put her in reverse. Turn the key. On his first attempt, the car turned over, caught, but then his foot slipped off the clutch and the Merc lurched a few inches before dying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Drat,” Eustace muttered. He slapped the steering wheel and tried again. This time he got the Merc started and then let her sit for a minute, listening to the engine. A little rough, but who knew how old the gas was? That led him to another important question: how much gas? He bent over the wheel and peered at the gauge, which stood at just under a quarter of a tank. He tapped the glass over the needle with a thick fingernail, but the gauge stayed put.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eustace grunted and revved the engine. Old or not, a Merc straight-six spoke with authority. With his face peeled back into a shit-eating grin, Eustace craned his head around, popped the clutch and slammed his foot down on the gas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The engine roared and the Merc launched backwards, punching through the garage door like a linebacker through the paper banner at a homecoming game. Jagged spikes of wood blew out all across Useless Son’s driveway as the Merc hurtled towards the street. Eustace screamed and jabbed his foot down on the break. The car squealed. Stalled. Panting, but still wearing that grin, he sat and looked at the hole he’d left in Useless Son’s garage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would take more than a little plywood to patch that action up. Eustace poked his head out the window and looked back for damage on the Merc. A few scrapes, but nothing serious. The ruckus set all the neighborhood hounds off again, but there was still no activity on the street. No mothers poking their heads out of their doors, no children pointing. Eustace supposed all the mothers were at work, just like the fathers, and their kids would be at school or in cold-storage somewhere, waiting for someone to bail them out. That’s how the world ran these days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eustace restarted the Merc and tried easing her into motion, but working the clutch woke the arthritis in his hip and knee. It took him three more stalls to maneuver the car to the end of the driveway. By then he was starting to get the hang of driving again, never mind the red throb rolling up and down his left leg. The Merc pulled out onto the street smoothly enough. From there, he made three right turns at random, passing more of those identical bulldog houses. They said he was too old to drive, and they were right; his cataracts demoted everything, stop signs, trees and cars parked on the curbs, to fuzzy shadows, identifiable only by color. Even so, Eustace felt great. He couldn’t stop smiling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But he needed a rest. His joints had unionized, led by his clutch-working knee, and were singing a high note. His breath came hard, the way he used to get after a hard day splitting logs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maintaining a wobbly fifteen, Eustace piloted the Merc down another six blocks, until he came to a neighborhood park. The Merc’s breaks moaned in protest as it came to a stop by the curb, in a patch of sun that beat nicely against the roof. Just a few minutes would do him up nicely. He swung his legs around and set them on the bench seat, the brown-bagged Peacemaker between his thighs. Stretched out, with his head resting on his suit coat, Eustace lit another Lucky and sighed out a streamer of smoke, watching the play of sun against bare branch in the tree above. Within seconds, he was asleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As he slept, he dreamed. Of Shirley, his wife. Of a Mexican whore who had gotten him drunk, given a tepid hand job and then stolen his wallet. He dreamed of other things too—all of it was disjointed. Wrenches that wouldn&amp;#39;t turn the bolt. A Cheshire grin. The smell of cigars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the whore, wiggling, giggling, paid for. Artifice. Artifice and not even that much of a pleasure, guilty or otherwise. But there’d been more than just the one, hadn’t there? Across the border into Juarez. Cheap as a dinner out and not one ever told him that he shouldn’t or that he should.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some how all of that dissolved into a new scene: Shirley and that whore, both of them, sitting on a couch and talking about him, like he wasn’t there, but he was, he could hear. What if it doesn&amp;#39;t work out? Shirley asked, How will he feed his children? The whore shook her head, her fat, powdered jowls wagging their disappointment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eustace woke up slowly and when his eyes finally opened, he felt far worse than he had pre-nap. His body had gummed up, like tired machinery filled with clotted grease. The cigarette had burned down between his fingers. He threw it out the open window and winched himself upright, using the door handle and the emergency brake for leverage. The sun still hovered well above the horizon, but its warmth was gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eustace started the car and pulled away from the curb with a jerk. As he drove, he tried to figure out if he was afraid or not. Something squirmed in his guts, but he couldn’t name it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heading generally north, he found a major road and took it. Cars passed by on the left in a steady stream and he found himself leaning forward, practically up to the windshield, trying to bring the moving shapes into some kind of focus. A truck behind him honked and flashed the high beams, before swerving into the other lane. The driver leaned out the window and shouted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eustace drove for about twenty minutes, his hands tight on the wheel. That building excitement, something like the urge to urinate, percolated in his belly. Finally, he found what he was looking for and pulled off the road into a large parking lot. He found a space up near the building and set the emergency brake, but left the car running. These things followed a certain protocol. He looked at the sign in front of the Merc. Handicap only. Well, he didn’t have the tag to hang from the Merc’s rearview any more than he had the state’s permission to operate a motor vehicle, but Eustace could think of a dozen ailments that qualified him for the cripple spot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His hands shook badly as he unrolled the pistol from the paper bag, and not all of it was old-man palsy. The Peacemaker gleamed in the winter sunlight. He stared at it for a moment, then broke the ancient firearm open again and checked its rounds one by one. Five minus the one he’d fired into Useless Son’s garage door. He went through again, shaking each bullet out gun and onto the Merc’s seat. They made a musical sound bouncing into each other. He picked one up and held it a few inches from his crooked nose. His mouth worked absently as he pondered the bullet. One bullet. Just for him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eustace put the single round into the Peacemaker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were no guards. That came as a disappointment. In his memory, there was always a fat guy, or maybe an older fellow like himself, stationed just inside the doors, usually sitting on a stool and trying not to doze off. Missing guard aside, the place hardly even seemed like a bank. No marble, no high ceilings and if there was a vault, Eustace couldn’t see it. Just a long counter, a few cubicles and some bland, barely audible jazz. Ah, but nevermind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The woman at the front desk smiled at Eustace as he passed. She had that patronizing smirk adults reserved for the very young or the very old. Eustace ignored her and made his way over to the courtesy stand near the tellers, where people could endorse their checks and tally up their deposits. He pulled a blank deposit slip from the stack and, using one of the bank’s pens-on-a-chain, he wrote out a short message, pausing for a moment while his moth-eaten brain tried to spell out “please.” There was an “a” in there somewhere, he thought, but couldn’t say for certain. Eventually, he scribbled over the whole word, deciding that the situation didn’t require that kind of civility anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Satisfied with his note, Eustace shuffled over to the line of folks waiting for a teller. His left shoe tapped out a rhythm on the bank’s carpet. When it was finally his turn, Eustace went up to the teller—a cute little thing, or so he half-imagined, not being able to see her very well—and set his deposit slip out on the counter, along with the now-empty grocery bag, which had been tucked under his arm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What can I do for you, sir?” the girl said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eustace looked down the row of tellers and then over his shoulder at the other customers. He tapped the deposit slip. The girl looked at it and cocked her head. Even Eustace could see the shift in her expression, from perky to disbelief. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Is this a joke?” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eustace shook his head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sir…” the teller said, trailing off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next teller down, an older woman, sensed something amiss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Is there a problem, Heather?” the older woman said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Margaret, this man, he…”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heather, the young teller, handed the note to Margaret. Margaret put on a pair of glasses that were hanging around her neck from a strand of plastic pearls and read the note. It took her a moment to decipher Eustace’s palsied chicken scratch, even though there was really only one thing a note like that could possibly say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sir, this isn’t funny. Are you here with someone? Is someone supposed to be watching you?” Margaret said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She thought he was senile. That really got Eustace’s goat. The deposit slip was perfectly clear, handwriting aside. He reached into his suit coat and grabbed hold of the blunderbuss concealed within. In his mind, the gun came free in one smooth motion, but somehow the sight at the end of the barrel got tangled in his waistband and refused to budge. The ladies gawked at him as he yanked, twisting his pants all out of whack. When the Peacemaker finally did come free, the front sight caught on his boxer shorts and jerked them up into his balls pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Nuuugghn,” Eustace moaned, stumbling back from the counter and bringing the pistol up with one hand while the other fluttered down to his injured testicles. The Peacemaker hardly looked like a real firearm; it was too big, half a size out of scale with everything else in the room, including Eustace. Heather screamed and put her hands to her face, like a lady was supposed to when confronted by a mouse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His balls hurt something fierce, but the old boys had stopped doing anything at all useful a long time ago, so he ignored them and kept his concentration on the tellers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sir,” Margaret said, putting her hands on her hips, “you put that thing down right now.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eustace pulled the hammer back, pointed the Peacemaker at the ceiling and fired. There was a terrific crack and the ceiling tile above Eustace blew apart. White bits, like chunky snow, rained down on his shoulders. When the gunshot stopped ringing in his ears, the whole bank had gone utterly silent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Madam,” he said, his voice clear and strong, “put the money in the bag and no one gets hurt. Understand?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hadn’t he spent his whole life wanting to say those words in earnest, all the way back to the time he’d been old enough to point a finger and yell “stickemup!” Oh glory, it was fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Do what the man says, Heather,” Margaret said, “just stay calm, sir, alright?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eustace was calm. He was also out of ammunition now, but Margaret didn’t know that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heather empted her cash drawer into the brown paper bag, and then handed it to Margaret, who did the same, including a bunch of rolled coins. There were two other tellers further down the counter, but Eustace snatched the bag from Margaret before she could hand it to the next in line. The sack had a nice heft—a couple of cats, maybe. Eustace wondered how much he was making off with. It was a simple curiosity, not greed. Ten dollars or ten thousand, it made no nevermind to him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving at top speed—a considerable effort for meager result—Eustace headed for the door. No one got in his way. Some folks even dropped to the floor with their hands over their heads, which was fine with Eustace, even though it wasn’t strictly necessary. When he finally reached the exit, a man in a shirt and tie actually held the door open for him. Eustace sketched a little salute with his left hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside, the Merc, now the Getaway Car, waited for him, idling in the cripple spot. He flung open the door and lowered himself in, cackling. His bones hardly hurt at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He popped the Merc into reverse and stomped on the gas. The old girl’s tires squealed—actually squealed!—and he clipped the car parked next to him, knocking the rearview mirror off and drawing a long black scratch across its doors. Two people had emerged from the bank, probably to get a look at the Merc’s plates. Let them look. Maybe they’d go and arrest Useless Son.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his excitement, Eustace lost track of the arrows directing him out of the parking lot and wound up driving a quick lap around a vacuum repair shop, before simply plowing over a low concrete planter filled with evergreen bushes and back out onto the main drag. The car bucked and swayed, throwing Eustace up against the rotting headliner and then sliding him across the seat so hard that he lost contact with the pedals and the engine stalled, leaving the Merc sprawled across two lanes of traffic while he crawled back behind the wheel and started her back up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He had no escape route planned. He just went, plunging straight ahead, ignoring red lights and yield signs. People honked and swerved out of his way. Swinging wide around a corner, he came within a half second of t-boning a minivan. The Merc, built in the days when gas could safely be guzzled, accelerated steadily, her wheezy guts really warming up for the first time in a long, long while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It didn’t take long for the cops to appear. They filled the rearview mirror with red and blue lights like fireworks on the fourth of July, but they couldn’t catch him. The Merc was a comet, a blur. Eventually, the road met an interstate highway and Eustace swerved across two lanes to make the onramp. The cops howled in pursuit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He headed west, up into the mountains, four nearly empty lanes of pristine blacktop. Traffic had snarled up in the eastbound lanes though, a stream of headlights in the growing dusk, worker bees headed home after a long day making honey for a queen they had probably never met. Eustace could imagine all those tired faces turning to watch his black Merc scream past, tailed by the cop cars and their flashing lights. It was a high speed chase, by God! Something to tell the wife about over supper that night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mountains ahead formed a jagged blue wall against the horizon. Eustace knew the freeway went through the mountains and all the way out into Utah. That was a lot of blacktop. Sadly, he was never going to see it. The Merc couldn’t hope to outrun the police cruisers forever. Worse, exhaustion was gaining on Eustace faster than the cops were gaining on his car. This needed an ending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Eustace was more or less letting the car drive herself by this point, he didn’t see any real harm in letting go of the steering wheel entirely. He grabbed the paper bag filled with his loot and ripped it open. Bills, some of them banded together, others loose, spilled onto his lap along with a silver cascade of change. How much had he owed the bank? It had seemed like a lot back then, but with out-of-control inflation that jerked a nickel bottle of Coke up to a dollar and some, maybe what he had in his lap came somewhere close to the amount they had taken his house for. Even-stevens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Ha!” Eustace yodeled, throwing his head back for the pure joy of revenge and motion and everything else. A concrete divider appeared before the Merc’s windshield and advanced at an alarming pace, but Eustace corrected his course almost casually and the Merc swerved away with whole inches to spare. He grabbed a fist full of those lose bills with his free hand and threw them out the window. The wind pulled them up into the sky. More moolah followed, just as fast as Eustace could chuck it. Quarters and nickels hit the blacktop and skipped up over the barrier in the middle of the interstate, where they landed on those commuter’s cars like hail, startling their driver’s attention away from the hurtling black Merc. An entire stack of bills splattered like a fragile bird against the windshield of one of the police cars behind him. It’s paper band burst and the bills flapped free, a month’s pay for the two cops inside, blowing away like still-green autumn leaves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eustace couldn’t stop cackling. All his life he’d been afraid, when he should have been a pirate. He tossed the last handful of available cash out the window. There was still more, but it was hiding under the floor mats or cruising around the back, riding the eddies moving through the car. One bill wrapped itself around the gearshift, flapping like a tiny flag. He watched it, fascinated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was then that the Merc died. It wasn’t out of gas, nothing temporary like that. A thunk rocked the car, he felt it through the seat, and then the engine just cut out. Probably a rod come loose. She was done. More than his years as a professional mechanic, being ninety-two and attending a funeral for just about everyone he had ever known made Eustace an expert at fatal sounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He shifted into neutral and glanced at the speedometer. At the moment of death they had been cruising along at eighty-five miles per hour. Not so shabby, but the freeway up into the mountains was steep and the Merc’s momentum bled away fast. Sixty, then fifty, then forty. Eustace pulled over to the shoulder and flipped on the emergency blinkers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cop cars formed up in a wide file behind the Merc, blocking off traffic. Eustace could see more flashing lights coming down from the mountains, eastbound in the westbound lanes. In just a few minutes they would have him surrounded. Good, good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Put your hands on the wheel,” a voice bellowed so loudly that Eustace was momentarily startled into thinking God had spoken to him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the policemen advanced on the car; crouched over with their guns pointed at the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just then, something next to Eustace exploded with a soft thump and the whole car was full of purple paint. It had gotten all over him, too. They did that. Put dye bombs in with the stolen loot. Why it had waited this long to go off, Eustace didn’t know. He started to laugh so hard that he couldn’t breathe, tears rolling down his cheeks. Until just then, he wouldn’t have guessed his body contained enough moisture for tears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Put your hands on the wheel,” the voice said again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eustace considered the gun on the seat next to him. It wasn’t loaded, but it could still serve a purpose. If he wanted it to. He could pick it up one last time. He could finish what he had started. He could go out in high style. A hail of gunfire. Another phrase that stung like clean whiskey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, was he done? The cops were there, waiting. Eustace looked at the Peacemaker. Put a hand on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Merc’s door swung open and Eustace emerged, one limb at a time, struggling to extract himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Stop,” the voice howled, “or we will shoot!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eustace did not stop. He pulled himself up to his full six feet (minus a few inches on account of his hump), in front of all those lights. He wouldn’t stop, not until they made him. Addled by exhaustion and the first squirts of adrenaline he’d enjoyed in many a long year, Eustace wasn’t sure they could stop him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was something he’d learned serving his country during the war in Europe, something those crazy Brit bastards did, their way of flipping someone off. It was the same thing Nixon did, only reversed, the back of the fingers out, instead of in. The way he understood it, the French once made a habit of cutting off their British captives’ first two fingers so they couldn’t shoot a longbow in war anymore. So, showing an enemy your two fingers in that wide V shape meant you were still dangerous, still able to put an arrow though a man’s heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He raised his gun hand, those two fingers up and spread, covered in purple dye. But he didn’t have the Peacemaker. It was still in the Merc. He stood there, rigidly at attention, saluting the cops with his two fingers until they put the cuffs on him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turned out, he wasn’t done after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The judge called Eustace the most audacious criminal he had ever sentenced and furthermore, the oldest bank robber on record, which tickled Eustace just to death. He clapped his hands together and cawed his old man laugh and goddamned if that judge didn’t smile a little bit as he banged the gavel down. Right there was a moment Eustace would have hated to miss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it wasn’t the last. They put Eustace in with a young buck, just fifty-one, serving time for counterfeiting and robbery and assault and murder and Lord knew what else. He was Mexican, with a little South American Dictator’s pencil mustache, but he spoke English pretty good. Since there was nothing else to do in the cell, Jesus (that’s HEY-soos, not GEE-zus) sometimes told stories about the crimes that got him thrown in jail. Screwing and shooting and outsmarting the hell out of people. Eustace had no idea how many of Jesus’s stories were true, how many were co-opted from someone else and how many were made up out of whole cloth, but the Mexican paced the floor of their cell like a tiger as he spun them, acting out the interesting parts, and wasn’t that better than a comatose roommate who only announced his presence by shitting himself? You betcha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eustace knew what happened in prison—shower room things—and a little of that went on, but no one ever bothered him, probably because he looked like a day-glow stick of beef jerky in his orange prison uniform and even worse out of it. On the few occasions someone gave him any hassle, Jesus and his Mexican buddies took care of it, because Jesus liked him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It got boring sometimes, but boredom was an old friend of his. To kill that old friend, he could watch television or read. The food was even good—well, better than it had been at the Eldercare—and they let him smoke, a verboten activity at the home. He paid for the cigs out of money he made swabbing out the bathrooms. He enjoyed that. He liked having a purpose again, even if it was scrubbing down stainless-steel johns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He would serve out his life here, however much of it remained, but he didn’t mind. He almost never thought about that Peacemaker and the messy deliverance it had once offered. Because there were prisons, and there were prisons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference being that this was a prison of his own making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A man could live in a place like that.&lt;/p&gt;

        <summary>Wherein I travel to distant lands, try to get a nice souvenir  and then engage in philosophical debate with policeman.</summary>
        <content>&lt;p&gt;Whenever anyone we know goes abroad, my brother asks them to buy him foreign porn.  More specifically, he wants fetish porn—midgets, obese women, goats, whathaveyou—on the pretense that this somehow encourages a traveler to engage in genuine, meaningful, enlightening cross-cultural…something.  Cross-cultural sex-offender convictions, likely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people have actually fallen for his line of crap.  Since guidebooks generally don’t include how to say “where you keepin’ them fukbooks with the fat gals?” in Norwegian, these “conversations” must also include pantomime and that’s what my brother is really after: nothing makes him happier than a little absurdity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also likes weird porn.  He&amp;#39;s working on many levels, all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because it gets relevant here in a moment, you also need to know that my brother is sort of a neophyte cat lady.  He owns two, talks about adopting more and even bought an enclosed baby stroller/bike trailer to take his otherwise indoor felines on tours of the neighborhood, safely enclosed by the trailer’s mesh sides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Front-loading ends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, we went to Turkey this summer and, as usual, my brother wanted his foreign fetish porn.  He wasn’t going to get it, but what the hell; a boy can dream.  On the evening of our second night in Istanbul, I went for a walk by myself armed with a backpack full of camera equipment.  Up in the Old City, I came across a wrought iron fence by an empty lot that was infested with cats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ahh, the elements of the title come together now, don’t they?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along this fence, on a raised concrete wall that extended up to about eye level, two cats were getting their freak on.  Have you ever seen cats making kittens?  It’s the kind of sex I-cut-myself-just-to-feel-something girls have with boys who were bad-touched by their uncles.  It’s biologically mandated sexual assault.  Daddy-cat bites mommy-cat on the neck while she tries to claw his face off and there’s just no way to tell if either party is enjoying themselves, but as animals go, at least it isn’t the usual disinterested three seconds of pumping.  Kitties know how to put on a show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I watched, it occurred to me that here was my brother&amp;#39;s Turkish porn.  Equipped as I was with a semi-professional photography outfit, I proceeded to document the beautiful event.  The cats didn’t mind.  They let me get right up close and, being the obsessive-compulsive that I am, a simple snapshot wouldn’t suffice when I could get a Pulitzer-quality photo of, well, cats fucking.  I wanted the perfect shot, him biting, her mid-yowl, the very definition of lust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You thought my brother strange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Directly across a narrow street from the fence stood the Istanbul Hilton.  With a doorman.  I heard him yelling something, presumably at me, but I don’t generally stop taking photos until yelling escalates to shouting and then the cop showed up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was I doing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing much, officer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cop proceeded to explain—via a series of world weary, disappointed frowns—that in Turkey people do not take pictures of cats having sex because it is a gross thing to do.  I defended myself by saying that the pictures were not for my own gratification and that I was merely a player in some sort of cross-continental performance art orchestrated by my brother.  An innocent, in other words and please don’t send me to Turkish prison as I have heard really bad things about Turkish prisons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He did not arrest me, but he did make me delete every picture of the copulating cats.  The few pictures I had of the other cats on the wall—the cats not having sex—he let me keep, even giving a thumbs up to those photos and smiling, the way a parent might after a toddler manages to use the toilet instead of filling their pants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We go abroad as cultural ambassadors.  It’s likely that I am the only American some people will ever meet.  It warms me to know that I have done my country proud.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Welcome Travelers, To Dublin</title>
        <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="http://www.zacharybell.net/content/2015/09/18/welcome-travelers-to-dublin.html/?utm_source=RSS&amp;utm_medium=RSS&amp;utm_campaign=WelcomeTravelersToDublin" />

        <id>//content/2015/09/18/welcome-travelers-to-dublin</id>
        <summary>We took this double-decker bus and maybe someone got murdered and then my mom didn&#39;t save my luggage from disaster.</summary>
        <content>&lt;p&gt;We lived in Loughborough, a grumpy, brick-and-gloom sort of place somewhere in the middle of England and my family was in Colorado. We hadn’t seen each other for a while, so they—my parents and my brother—decided to come for a visit. Since Loughborough doesn&amp;#39;t have any particular sights to see, we decided to go to Ireland, which was just a few hours north. They met us at the airport. Everyone hugged, we collected our baggage. Then we realized that it was late—well past midnight—and that the trains had stopped running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Let&amp;#39;s get a cab,&amp;quot; I said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just then a double-decker bus rolled past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Ooooooh,” my mother said.  An American tourist fresh of the plane cannot resist a double-decker bus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Seriously. Let’s take a cab,” I said.&lt;span class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;I get sick on buses. I also get seasick, trainsick, ferriswheelsick and pogosick. The double-deckers are the worst; those second stories swings out wide around ever curve. It&amp;#39;s like riding out swells in a crow&amp;#39;s nest.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humbug. My mother was in the Ireland now and by God, she were going to ride the double-decker bus. So we worked out the schedule and got on the next one that passed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There are some seats there, behind the driver,” I suggested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Second floor!” my mother demanded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up the stairs we went, burdened with a pair of large duffel bags and a flock of those suitcases with the wheels and the handle. A couple of unsmiling Filipino maids sat in the front row and a trio of teenage boys were near the back, passing a joint and giggling. &lt;span class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;Someone is always smoking a joint on the upper deck of those busses.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hello Americans!” the teenagers said, upon hearing our accents. They stowed the joint, in deference to my mother, who glared at them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Are you Justin Timberlake?” one said to my brother. Though slouchy and predisposed to dress like a homeless man, my brother does look a little like Timberlake, especially at night, while wearing an uncharacteristically preppy souvenir Guinness sweater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sing something, Justin!” the Irish lads demanded. To help him along, the Irish lads broke into a their own version of &lt;em&gt;Rock Your Body&lt;/em&gt;, with perfect, clear Irish voices, even singing in the round for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Don’t be so quick, don’t be so quick, don’t be so quick…”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“To walk away!” my brother croaked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My father had no idea who the Backstreet Boys were, but he joined in the singing. So did my wife and I. Even stoned almost past walking, the lads were charming. By that point, only the Filipino maids and my mother were still silent, the maids keeping a wary eye on things and my mother—who is not a social creature—staring straight ahead, one of the duffel bags set squarely on the floor between her knees. The experience of riding the Irish bus was being thoroughly ruined for her by the presence of the Irish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few stops later another man got on and wove his way up the spiral staircase. He glared amicably at everyone and then settled in at the very back, bottle in hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That man is drunk, Justin,” one of the Irish lads whispered conspiratorially to my brother, “I’m sorry for that.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yes,” one of the other lads agreed, “A drunk Irishman. And I’m a leprechaun. Welcome to Dublin.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Did you know that this one here,” one Irish lad put his arm around his friend’s shoulders, “was once in a sausage commercial?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hadn’t known that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s true,” the other lad admitted, “I debated trading me grandma for sausages.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In the commercial,” the first lad clarified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’m almost as famous as you, Justin,” the second lad said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That’s right. Don’t be so fast,”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“To walk away,” my brother croaked. The Irish lads decamped from their bench and joined my brother on his, displaying a sort of instant European camaraderie that creeps Americans out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Fuckya,” the drunk said from the back. It wasn&amp;#39;t clear if he was into the singing or trying to pick a fight. The Irish lads pointedly ignored him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few stops later, while my brother and the lads sang more Timberlake, another drunk got onto the bus. This drunk put the other to shame, not merely swaying, but slamming from one side of the isle to the other while flailing his arms around. He had a bag of McDonalds’ in one hand and a super-size Coke in the other. Finally, and maybe this should have led the list, the man was wearing a white jumpsuit covered in blood. It wasn’t as if he was bleeding on himself. This was definitely someone else’s blood. There were handprints and long streaks where he had wiped his palms. Maybe he was a butcher. Maybe he had spent the evening dismembering his victims in a basement. Whatever it was, it had driven him to drink. The physical force of his drunk-waves stunned even the Irish lads into temporary silence. He grinned at everyone and then settled into the back of the bus, next to the earlier drunk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Jaaaaayzuz,” one of the Irish lads said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Does he have a knife?” the second Irish lad said, “Looks like he should have a knife and onna those hockey masks, right?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I want to assure you that the gentleman back there is not a representative of the Irish people,” the third Irish lad said with a stoned sincerity, “You’re going to have a lovely holiday. Don’t worry.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bus rolled on. The Irish lads told us more about the sausage commercial and sang songs with my brother. They demonstrated how their brogues could quickly dissolve into something completely unlike English and then quizzed us on the gibberish shooting out of their mouths. Then, faintly at first, then louder, I heard the sound of running water. Like a fountain, a happy splashing that went on and on. And on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took a moment to figure out what was happening and even then, accounts vary. One of the drunks, either the blood-covered man, or the more nondescript drunk, was pissing against the back of the seat in front of him. I say it was the nondescript drunk, but my wife insists it was the man in the blood-covered jumpsuit. Perhaps, and this is a radical theory, it was both of them simultaneously. It was a lot of piss. They were both smiling at everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Aaaaahhh, noevnanafukinbloosh!” one of the Irish lads declared, hopping up on top of the bench&lt;span class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;Rough translation from the origional Irish: ‘Not even a fucking blush!’.&lt;/span&gt; The piss found the isle and sloshed latterly as the bus went around a corner. My wife, my father, my brother and I all hauled ourselves and our luggage up onto the benches and out of harm&amp;#39;s way, but my mother, who had been vigorously ignoring everything around her for the last forty minutes, stared directly ahead, the duffel bag still planted firmly on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Mom!” my brother said, reaching forward to shake her shoulder, “mom!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No luck. The piss rolled under our seats, so fresh that it had a head to it, like beer. It hit the bottom of the duffel bag—my duffel bag as it happened—two inches deep and swept around my mother’s shoes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Noevenablush!” the Irish lad shouted again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Filipino maids had chosen to adopt my mother’s ignore-it-and-it-might-go-away tactics, but they knew to raise their feet. Then the bus accelerated and the tide rolled back in, re-soaking the bag, making the Irish lads shout. Piss found the spiral staircase down into the first deck and formed a waterfall like the elevator doors opening in Kubrick’s &lt;em&gt;The Shining&lt;/em&gt;. A pause. Dismayed screams echoed hollowly up from below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every curve, stop sign or hill made the piss dash around the bus like an ugly puppy until, eventually, blessedly, the bus finally came to our stop. We hauled our luggage gingerly across the aisle and down the dripping stairs. Urine had made it as far as the yellow do-not-stand-in-front-of-this line. People glared at us, as if we were party to whatever horrorshow had gone on upstairs. When the doors opened, it’s likely that a few drops plipped into the gutter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we stepped out of the urine charnel bus and into the slightly sodden night, my brother picked up the duffel bag my mother had failed to save from the drunks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hello Dublin!” my brother shouted, “This bag smells like human pee!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Wait!” one of the Irish lads called after us. He had hopped off the bus and now he trotted up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is my old neighborhood,” he explained, “and I know just where your hotel is. I’ll show you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Well thank you,” my mother said, suddenly society-polite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yeah thanks,” my brother said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Ain’t no thing, Justin,” he said, mistaking Hollywood black for American, as almost everyone in Europe will do. It&amp;#39;s either black or cowboy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Irish lad was terribly, genuinely embarrassed. He gave us a midnight tour of the neighborhood as we tramped over to the hotel. He apologized on the drunks’ behalf. He shook all of our hands in front of the hotel. He offered to give us his cell phone number in case we needed anything while we were in Dublin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What none of us told him—what we didn’t have the words or time to express—was that we had all loved the bus ride. That it had been my family’s idea of a perfect evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone except my mother, but she would recover. She always does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;So, this story relies completely on stereotypes of one variety or another, I want you to know that it is also one hundred percent true, after making some allowance for my faulty memory. Not that I am in the habit of lying, I just want to make it clear that I didn’t embellish here. It really happened and I have witnesses if you don’t believe me. The Irish really are—or were in this case at least—horrible, horrible drunks.&lt;span class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;Though the British are worse drunks, in my experience&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happily, stereotypes cut both ways. After working and living among the Irish, I can also say they are also among the most hospitable people I have ever had the pleasure of knowing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <summary>Albert wants to get the man who proposed plate tectonics removed from highschool textbooks.</summary>
        <content>&lt;p&gt;George walked into the diner and the bell above the door jingled. Albert was already on his stool, bent over a sheet of paper, laborously writing with a stub of a pencil, his coffee shoved off to the side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Best finish that homework, Albert,” George said, seating himself two stools down, “Bus’ll be here soon.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Shut up,” Albert said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What’s he doing?” George said to Patrice as she came by with his coffee. It was early and George and Albert were the diner’s only customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“He’s writing to the school board. You want the usual?” Patrice said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Oh. Yeah, usual’s fine,” George said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Coming right up.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patrice slapped the bell and Javier, somewhere out of sight in the kitchen, grunted a sleepy reply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Pat?” George said after a moment&amp;#39;s consideration, “Why’s Albert writing the school board?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“He’s trying to get the theory of plate tectonics removed from high school textbooks.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Now comes the part where I ask why he’d do such a fool thing, but I ain’t gonna, because I don’t care.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Board of education is working on textbook guidelines again,” Patrice said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Huh,” George said. He sipped loudly from his coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ask, goddamnit,&amp;quot; Albert said, staring at George in that way he had of staring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What’ve you got against plate tectonics, Albert?” George finally said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Nothing. I’m continental drift’s biggest fan,” Albert said, returning to his letter. He wrote with the single-minded squint of a second grader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“So…”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“So, a theory hasn’t really hit its stride until some chromosome-poor jaw-tumor tries to get it removed from the curriculum.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Which is what you’re doing now.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Alfred Wegener was a badass, dog eating, arctic son of a bitch. I want half the people drawing X&amp;#39;s on his grave and the other half forming a mob to dig up his corpse and put it on trial posthumously.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than ask Alfred for clarification on any of this—never a good idea—George looked over at Patrice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Alfred Wegner is the fella that first came up with the idea of continental drift,” Patrice offered, “ain’t that just what we need? Another Alfred, I mean.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yes. The more Alfreds the better,” Alfred said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Did you just know that Wegner guy’s name, Pat? Am I the only ignoramus here?” George said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No no,&amp;quot; Patrice said, &amp;quot;I’ve been listening to our Albert go on for almost an hour now. It’s been an unwilling education.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yep. Alfred Wegner&amp;#39;s name should be there with Charles Darwin, but he&amp;#39;s never been villified propperly. I wanted Fred Phelps and his Westborough people to do it for me, but I don’t think they understand enough about plate tectonics to get a good religious panic going.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That and I don&amp;#39;t recall that the Bible has a lot to say about continental drift,” George said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Plate tectonics is at least partially responsible for most speciation. We have kangaroos in Australia and llamas in Peru because the continents drifted apart. So there&amp;#39;s an evolution angle. It doesn&amp;#39;t allow for any young-earth bullshit either, because the plates move slower than glaciers. We&amp;#39;re talking, like, a hundred thousand years is an afternoon&amp;#39;s nap for a continent. That should be more than enough to contradict some Biblical bibble-babble.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Instead of getting diatribe all over my eggs, trying keeping your next monologue &lt;em&gt;internal&lt;/em&gt;,” George suggested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Helio-centric model got its due. They threw Galileo into a tower and the Indigo Girls wrote a song about him,” Alfred said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The who did what?” George said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You ever actually listened to that song, Albert?” Patrice said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hell no. I prefer real music to acoustic lesbians.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Then why did you—? Nevermind,” Patrice said. Albert was--at best--an experience, but rarely a pleasure. She pulled a rag from a bucket and set to wiping down the counter between the kitchen and the dining area, turning her back on the men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Albert waved off her snub with an imperious, graphite-smudged hand and went back to sermonizing, “And everyone knows who Darwin was. They still argue evolution vs. bedtime stories. Reactionary idiots dumped ice water on Ed Wilson&amp;#39;s head for sociobiology. That&amp;#39;s not a Snopes Monkey Trial, but at least it&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“So, out of a sense of...fairness, you want this this other Albert, the Wegener fella, you want his name removed from textbooks?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No. I want someone to try to remove his name from the textbooks. Until your ideas have made a racing fan, be they NASCAR or chariot, wonder if they really will see grandma in fairyland after they die, then you haven’t arrived. Vilification is vindication. A parable.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alfred accompanied this speech with waggles of his pencil, as if directing the motley orchestra of his mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You believe that, huh?” George said. Patrice slid his eggs across the counter with an eye-roll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The theory of plate tectonics is one of the most elegant, important ideas man has ever had,&amp;quot; Alfred said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I ain’t disagreeing,&amp;quot; George said, &amp;quot;but maybe most scientists don&amp;#39;t care for immortality? Ideas matter more than getting full credit. Alfred Wallace, just as an example.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patrice, who had been half-following the conversation, turned around, her hands on her hips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Great,” she said, “yet another Alfred.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Oh yeah,” George said, “Didn’t even think of that until after I said it. He’s the chap that came up with the idea of evolution concurrently with Darwin. Almost published his work before &lt;em&gt;Orgin&lt;/em&gt;, but held off and wound up spending his life in Darwin’s shadow, actually defending Darwin&amp;#39;s writing. I think he was happy enough in just knowing the idea got loose and that--”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Alfred &lt;em&gt;Wegener&lt;/em&gt; risked his life for answers,” Alfred interrupted, “The man went to the Arctic for the sake of science. He got frostbite and cut his toes off with a penknife. When the expedition ran out of food, he killed and ate his sled dogs--&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I was wondering about the dog-eating part,&amp;quot; George said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;--and he eventually died up there in Greenland. He died for &lt;em&gt;science&lt;/em&gt;. I want to see him enter the canon for his achievements.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Got nothing to do with him having your name?&amp;quot; Patrice said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Maybe a little,” Albert said, returning to the letter.&lt;/p&gt;

        <summary>A man has a long-overdue conversation with his beer. It&#39;s kind of an intervention—in reverse.</summary>
        <content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;American Male:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay, Coors, so it&amp;#39;s cool about those twins. I mean yeah, I like twins. Cheerleaders are good too, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coors Beer:&lt;/strong&gt; Twins, right? And cheerleaders! Fuckin&amp;#39;-a!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;American Male:&lt;/strong&gt; Thanks to the internet my tastes have evolved towards something a little more, uhh, specific, but tits and short skirts still tickle the lizard brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coors Beer:&lt;/strong&gt; I got your back, buddy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;American Male:&lt;/strong&gt; Uh huh. Last night I saw another one of your commercials, you know, where the woman spreads a trail of rose petals across the floor of the kitchen and meets her guy wearing lingerie. I don&amp;#39;t know, she&amp;#39;s horny, or she wants to do something nice for the dude or...I don&amp;#39;t know. Maybe she&amp;#39;s insecure about their relationship. That&amp;#39;s reading a lot into it. Anyway, she says &amp;#39;like what you see?&amp;#39; to him and he&amp;#39;s like &amp;#39;yeah,&amp;#39; but he&amp;#39;s looking at his beer in the fridge and not her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coors Beer:&lt;/strong&gt; The commercial runs counter to expectations. The man ignores the advances of a woman. That&amp;#39;s what makes it funny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;American Male:&lt;/strong&gt; He&amp;#39;s supposed to be me, right? The everyman so beaten down that he can&amp;#39;t get it up. She&amp;#39;s a good looking woman, but that guy on the commercial has absolutely no interest in her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coors Beer:&lt;/strong&gt; Sometimes a guy just wants to kick back and have a cold one, right? No hassles!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;American Male:&lt;/strong&gt; No. It&amp;#39;s accurate. Shit&amp;#39;s been bad. I got laid off forever ago. You know that. Money&amp;#39;s tight and the kids, well, I don&amp;#39;t want to talk about the kids. So sex isn&amp;#39;t really a priority for me. Not that my wife spends much time throwing around rose pedals in her underwear. She&amp;#39;s been grabbing all the overtime she can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coors Beer:&lt;/strong&gt; You&amp;#39;re making me sad. Don&amp;#39;t do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;American Male:&lt;/strong&gt; Sometimes I feel like I&amp;#39;m trying to be two different demographics for you. Or, like, you&amp;#39;re selling beer to my depression and my crotch at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coors Beer:&lt;/strong&gt; It&amp;#39;s the circle of life!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;American Male: *&lt;/em&gt;Mercenary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coors Beer:&lt;/strong&gt; Yup. Guilty. If genital warts or suicide sold beer...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;American Male:&lt;/strong&gt; Whatever. Look, as long as a case of Coors costs a buck less than a case of Bud down at the C &amp;amp; J, I&amp;#39;m your loyal drunk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coors Beer:&lt;/strong&gt; High five!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;American Male:&lt;/strong&gt; Still, something about that &amp;#39;like what you see?&amp;#39; commercial really bothered me. It wasn&amp;#39;t the woman, or that you can&amp;#39;t decide if women are the sportscar or a beartrap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Coors Beer: *&lt;/em&gt;What?  I don&amp;#39;t understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;American Male: *&lt;/em&gt;Remember, I am pretty drunk.  Anyway, what bothers me is the &amp;#39;is your beer cold?&amp;#39; gimmick. Those little things on the can that turn blue when the can gets cold? The mountains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coors Beer:&lt;/strong&gt; Cold-Activated bottles and cans: know when your beer is ready to party!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;American Male:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. I hate those things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coors Beer:&lt;/strong&gt; Let me guess: you can tell when your beer is cold by touching it? We caught some of that during the focus testing, but--&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;American Male:&lt;/strong&gt; No. It pisses me off that you think there&amp;#39;s a right way to enjoy your shitty product, that it matters if it&amp;#39;s exactly the right temperature. I&amp;#39;m an out-of-work, nostalgic frat boy with four kids and an on-again-off-again case of impotence. I drink your beer warm while I sit in the garage all by myself and stare into space. Once I left an open can on top of the barbecue grill for three days, rediscovered it, and then drank it down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coors Beer:&lt;/strong&gt; Whoa now, I think--&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;American Male: *&lt;/em&gt;Those little blue mountains are a cocktail umbrella sticking out of a dog turd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Coors Beer: *&lt;/em&gt;Speaking of drinking it down, I think you&amp;#39;ve killed that soldier. Want another? Look, they&amp;#39;re cold!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;American Male:&lt;/strong&gt; ...yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coors Beer:&lt;/strong&gt; Great.&lt;/p&gt;

        <summary>…performed atop a McDonald’s trashcan by an eight year old.</summary>
        <content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First Bratz Doll:&lt;/strong&gt; It&amp;#39;s time to play reality show!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second Bratz Doll:&lt;/strong&gt; Cooking or shouting?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First:&lt;/strong&gt; Shut up!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second:&lt;/strong&gt; Look at me!  I&amp;#39;m skating!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Second Bratz doll pirouettes across top of McDonald&amp;#39;s trashcan)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second:&lt;/strong&gt; If you want a rose, it&amp;#39;s a game, but I&amp;#39;m going to win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First:&lt;/strong&gt; Who&amp;#39;s the faaaaaaatttttest dog?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(First Bratz doll makes barking sounds)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second:&lt;/strong&gt; That&amp;#39;s not enough!  Try harder!  Make it work!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First:&lt;/strong&gt; You can&amp;#39;t talk to me that way!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Bratz dolls attack one another atop the McDonald&amp;#39;s trashcan)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second:&lt;/strong&gt; I see that skirt!  You stole it.  It&amp;#39;s my design!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Bratz combat continues)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First:&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;#39;m keeping all the stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second:&lt;/strong&gt; Go faster!  You have to go faster!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Bratz dolls collide like bull elk in rut.  The first falls into the trashcan.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh no!  I love you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(The second Bratz doll leaps into the trashcan after the first.  There is a moment of silence.  Girl begins to cry.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mom:&lt;/strong&gt; Angel, come over here and eat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Girl peers into trashcan, shrugs, goes off to eat Happy Meal.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <summary>This land ain&#39;t my land. This land ain&#39;t your land.</summary>
        <content>&lt;p&gt;The dinosaurs retired the field. Hole-hiding, seed-snuffling mammals poked their snouts into the ash-filled sky and realized they had accidentally inherited everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a race to fill the void opened by the departed dinosaurs and the sloths won. This was on the other side of the ice age. The sloths were not the fastest, not by any measure, but the race doesn&amp;#39;t always honor the fastest. The opposite, in fact. Ask a cheetah about lions. No. The sloths were not fast--they were sloths--but they were the largest. At least some of them. Up on their haunches, these mega-sloths were so tall that only trees could compete with their height. Nothing hunted them. Nothing even tried. Gargantuan, the ends of their forepaws draped with dagger-length claws, sloths had come to the apex of their particular pyramid. They ate what they liked, went where whim took them, mated infrequently because their young almost never died.&amp;lt;!-- more --&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then men came to the frost-tipped plains that had once been icebound but were now merely tundra. They sloths were not impressed. We are suited to the land, the sloths boasted, immune to cold and fang, but the men had spears and a horrifying coordination between their numbers and the sloths were killed and eaten and then gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Men usurped the plains and killed off most everything larger than a dog and what remained--bison and the shyest bears--were either forced to the fringes where the men weren&amp;#39;t, or kept as a sort of self-filling larder. This is the land and we are the land, the men said, meaning that the land was them, but another race was already in progress, again not for speed, but this time not for size either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new men had steel and they dressed in steel instead of feathers. They were armed with muskets and they carried smallpox bred in far-off hive-cities. This is our land, the sloth-and-bison-hunters said, we are formed to it and it to us and the newcomers didn&amp;#39;t love the land, or even see the land, except as a commodity. The land it not beautiful to them. They will not know what they have lost. The new men had not grown against the land, but by steel or disease they took it anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new men named the land. Kansas and Oklahoma. They disinterestedly slaughtered the bison and had no memory of sloths that overtopped trees. They laid down poor farms and wrung out the land with cotton that had no business growing in the Midwestern desert. The cotton did grow for a while, but then the rains didn&amp;#39;t come and the men turned to a new creature, larger than sloths, called the Bank. The Bank&amp;#39;s size couldn&amp;#39;t be measured in units of length and it didn&amp;#39;t eat anything that the land produced. The men took out loans from the Bank, hoping to survive, but the rains didn&amp;#39;t come for the third year running and there were no crops and the loans couldn&amp;#39;t be repaid. This is our land, the farmers said as the sheriffs and bulldozers came to evict them, Grandpa fought the Indians here, killed the Indians here. Grandpa died on the land, his bones are buried in the land. The land et Grandpa up and we can&amp;#39;t leave the land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the Bank owned the land and became a creature of the land and called itself Con-Agra. It thought itself immune to races of all sorts. Even insects were not allowed on the Bank&amp;#39;s land, only cotton, only corn, only cattle but the Bank was too large for the land. It drank so much water so that rivers never met the sea. Insatiable, the Bank sucked more water from aquifers that had formed in the time of the sloths until the aquifers were gone. The Bank&amp;#39;s only predator was itself and it died of thirst. Of worse things, symptoms of that thirst.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The men who remained took the land again. At first they were armed with remnant silicon, then only steel, then hides and feathers once again. They were farmers with nothing left to grow and ever fewer. No one took the land from them because the land no longer had anything to offer, not without a long rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Farmers, in desperation, in ignorance, became hunters, then scroungers, but there were no sloths, no bison. We could have loved the land better, the men said. All along we could have loved it better. Learned too late, the lesson could not save them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wind inherited the land and the race was delayed for a time. Then a rabbit, not large, nor quick, nor clever, but accepting of death, a rabbit who somehow bred itself around the radiation--was perhaps encouraged by the radiation--sat up on its haunches, checked the sky and sniffed, considering its options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[Note: This is written with a half-apology to John Steinbeck. I agree with the man almost completely and yet infuriates me as I&amp;#39;m reading. You&amp;#39;re too pat, Mr. Steinbeck, though I like your prose.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, what follows will make a lot more sense if you&amp;#39;ve readThe Grapes of Wrath _ recently. Which you probably haven&amp;#39;t._&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t strive for relevance.]&lt;/p&gt;

        <summary>The further adventures of our time-traveling hero and one time Hitler-assassin. Also, a priest gets laid and some grain is brought to market.</summary>
        <content>&lt;p&gt;The cart, filled to toppling with hay and pulled by a single mule, moved along the forest track at a walking speed. Ralph Miles drove, nearly enveloped by the hay piled behind him, chaff in his beard and furring the top of his hat. At the moment he was asleep, hunched into himself and snoring, the reins held loosely in his hand, but the mule knew the way along the double track without his help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John le Lung, fifteen and a nephew of Ralph, walked along the embankment beside the cart, swatting at daisy heads with a switch. Every so often the mule would stop—she was old and spavined to the point of deformity—and when she did, John would smack her on the rump with his switch and she would glare at him briefly before lurching back into motion. John would make a handsome man once his features all grew into themselves, but for now his Adam’s apple nearly led his nose and he walked like he was falling down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The forest around them was young, but dense, alive with songbirds of all sorts. Every so often, a stone chimney grew up between the trees, evidence that this place had not always been wooded; there had been a village here once, before the great Pest. How quickly the wild reasserted itself. We’re all renters, that’s all, Ralph’s mother used to say. His Lordship in his castle, the Bishop and his miter, and the peasant most of all. God have mercy on all us renters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the wagon rolled down the gentle slope towards the ford in the creek, it came around a bend and there, sitting spry as a goat atop a boulder, was Brother Gilbert le Armurer. He was thin, with sleepy-lidded eyes and the sort of narrow, pointed beard a grass snake might grow, if it were able.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Ho there!” Brother Gilbert hollered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ralph awoke with a start, yanked on the mule’s reins, and the entire endeavor came to a creaking, swaying halt. The friar stood, hiked his filthy robes up to his shanks and hopped off the boulder and onto the path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Is that you, Ralph Miles?” Friar Gilbert said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Well, it were this morning, when I saw myself in the pisspot,” Ralph said, then yawned into his hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“And hello to you as well, John,” Friar Gilbert said. The boy waved shyly from behind the wagon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Give you a ride, brother? We’re to the market in Schrosberie,” Ralph said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Good luck, it is. There I sat, asking if it were wiser to wear through the thin soles of my sandals, or wait here for the Lord to provide. And here you are. I’m to Schrosberie myself. I’ve been invited to sermonize the guilds,” Friar Gilbert said, accepting a hand up from Ralph into the cart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I saw the rest of you blackfriars this morning, mounted up on their asses with dust in their wake. They passed me and the boy two days ago. Said they wanted to be in Schrosberie before the market opened,” Ralph said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yes, well I was detained,” Brother Gilbert said, pushing the hay back enough to settle in against it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Detained at the inn?” Ralph said, clucking the mule into motion again. The wagon heaved up out of a rut with a clatter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As it happens,” Brother Gilbert said, drawing his black cloak snug over his white robes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Ministering to the innkeep’s eldest, I suppose? I hear that one does ablutions with her ankles somewhere in the vicinity of her ears.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’m sure I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Brother Gilbert said, then, changing the subject, “Do you know what I found just recently?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That the innkeep’s daughter had a new child sired sometime around last year’s market? One born perhaps clasping the rosary?” Ralph said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Not at all. I found this. It was with a pile of scrolls the prior wanted me to sort.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brother Gilbert reached into his cloak and produced a small book. It was black and unadorned, hardly larger than the span of his palm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I do recognize that,” Ralph said, a smile cracking his beard, “It has been a long time. What? Twenty years? More?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What is it?” John said, chinning up over the lip of the wagon to peer at the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is the diary of a man your uncle and I used to know. A curious man,” Brother Gilbert said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Curious is too dainty a word. Full-moon mad’s more to the tune,” Ralph added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Alvys Wosinton, the Mad Sorcerer,&amp;quot; Brother Gilbert said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story will continue later. Or not. We&amp;#39;ll see.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <summary>No one can tell you how to mourn.</summary>
        <content>&lt;p&gt;Chad was already on the hill when Millie arrived.  She saw him up there, hands in his pockets, staring down at the ground.  She got out of her car and opened an umbrella against the drizzle.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hello,” Chad said as Millie came up behind him.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Lovely weather we&amp;#39;re having,” Millie said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wet grass had soaked through her pumps and the stockings under them.  The rain was very much on her mind. It rained every year.  At first that seemed normal—it was April and it was Washington State—but every year? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chad shrugged.  Millie looked down at the bronze plate, set in a pad of concrete no bigger than a pillowcase.  Heather Paula Fendin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hello, Heather,” Millie said down at the plaque, then, to Chad, “Have you been here long?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Half an hour.  My flight got in mid-morning.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He had a day or two’s growth on his cheeks and some of it came in gray.  His temples too.  It hadn’t been there the year before.  Otherwise, he looked about the same.  He wore a suit and patent shoes.  Rain dripped off the longest lock of hair on his forehead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You’ve got a little snow on the mountain.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yeah,&amp;quot; Chad said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Millie’s own hair would have surrendered entirely to old age some years ago if she didn’t paint it auburn in the sink twice a month.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think you’re the only person I never see dry.  There’s another umbrella in the car, but I don’t suppose you want it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No thank you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Penance?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Something like that.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Got a hair shirt under that suit?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He chuckled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“How old are you?” Millie said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Thirty-three this December.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“So you’ve been coming here longer than…”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Longer than she was alive.  I was just thinking about that.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I was so angry when I heard you were flying down here every year.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That’s why I always came two weekends before the…you know, before the fourteenth.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And I was mad at you for being so polite.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ll come in March, if you prefer. Or February.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I asked you to come on the fourteenth, didn’t I?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Millie remembered the bouquet of lilies in her left hand and bent to set them on the grave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I was so angry about everything.  Angry that you could afford plane tickets.  If you were coming all the way out from New York, then you should have to take the bus. Or walk. Crawl.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sorry.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tears came.  Millie looked up into the rain to hide them.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I saw your picture in the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; once.  At some society party to raise awareness about the…who-knows-what.  The manatee, maybe.  I saw that picture and I thought a &lt;em&gt;lawyer&lt;/em&gt;.  A fucking &lt;em&gt;manatee&lt;/em&gt; lawyer.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Millie didn’t usually cuss, but now the profanity rolled out smooth and natural.  Chad watched with his hands down in his pockets, the rain falling off of his face.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I thought, ‘he should have married her, not killed her,’” Millie said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He chuckled again. He had a good, textured voice. Deep and somehow comforting, despite his melancholy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Never happen.  She was smarter than I was and she knew it.  I never knew how much she even liked me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You are married, aren’t you? Someone told me that.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She’d never asked him about his personal life. Not because she didn’t want to know, but because it felt like intruding. He took his hand out of his pocket and showed Millie the ring.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What does your wife think about this?” Millie gestured at the grave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We fight about it ever year,” Chad said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But you still come.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yes I do.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was handsome, but tired.  The growing creases around his mouth and eyes outlined a hungry, unhappy face. Good, she thought and then mentally took it back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Would you stop coming?  If I asked?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He shook his head.  The rain suddenly doubled, driving divots into the mud.  Neither of them commented on it.  Another moment of silence stretched out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Before she died, I had made my plans,” Chad finally said, “I was going to be a rich guy’s kid.  I was going to be happy with privilege.  I told my dad I would go to law school, but I didn&amp;#39;t mean it.  But then she did die and I…”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You became her,” Millie said, “I know.  Manatees.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yeah.  I did.  She was the one with the treefrog posters and the hemp tennis shoes.  I just played along to get laid.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He looked at her cautiously, from the corner of his eye.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Want to know something else?  While we’re being honest?” Millie said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He laughed low and shoved his hands deeper into his pockets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If you want to tell me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’d stopped coming.  For almost ten years.  At first I would walk up here every day.  Three miles. I did crawl, it felt like. I’d come up here and I’d talk to her and hate you.  Then it was every week and then every month and then just not.  I told myself it hurt too much, but really I just had living to do. I’d take the dog to the park or get my nails done instead.  I got a divorce, I got a new man.  I just stopped coming.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That’s not so bad.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“When I heard about what you were doing, I swore that I wouldn’t let you out-mourn me.  But I’m happy.  I can’t stop being happy.  I have her picture on my desk at work, but I don’t remember the last time I looked at it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I keep her prom picture in my wallet.  Even my wife doesn’t know that.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But you don’t love her still, I hope.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I never did.  I just killed her.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You didn’t. A telephone pole killed her. A dashboard killed her.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“So I became her and you don’t miss her and yet here we are.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chad was crying.  Millie automatically pretended not to notice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Death is strange,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Not like living, it isn’t.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’ll see you next year then?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yeah,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
