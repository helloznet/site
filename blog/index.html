We were also in Croatia, Slovenia, Italy and Prague. Being as we all hail from the land of Purple Mountain Majesty and Valley of the High-Fructose Corn Syrup, it’s a good bet that no one here knows where any of those places are. And honestly, who would care? The up country is Canada and that other one, the sturdy leg to Florida's gimpy leg, that’s the land of Drug Murder. No more geography, yeah?</p><p>But! I just called you ignorant. Admit it, you are! Before your feelings get too badly bruised, let me tell you that before I had fifteen hours of airplane time to acquaint myself with the guidebook, I didn’t know where any of these places were either. Seriously. I had no idea. That’s how prepared I am when we launch into one of these glob-trotting episodes.</p><p>Since wandering blindly into foreign lands is what I do, and since you don't know a single goddamned thing about all of this, let's get educated together.</p><h3>Turkey:</h3><p>Big. Covers what remains of the Ottoman Empire, which in turn covered much of what remained of Rome, which was actually a goodly chunk of what remained of the Greek Empire. It’s a Muslim country now, but Istanbul was Eastern Orthodox Christian until the middle 1400s (just a few decades before Columbus, Ocean Blue, et al.) These days Turkey wants to be part of the European Union but France gets all sniffy about headscarves which would make for uncomfortable Christmases. So far Europe has sort of left Turkey's application in the drawer.</p><h3>Italy:</h3><p>It’s shaped like a boot. Can’t miss it.</p><h3>Yugoslavia:</h3><p>Old enough to remember the Yugo car? A real piece of shit. This is where it came from. Also site of that-war-during-the-Clinton-administration-no-one-understood-but-at-least-it-didn’t-turn-into-an-eternal-clusterfuck-like-Iraq. Yugoslavia no longer exists. Relevant only here because…</p><h3>Croatia:</h3><p>used to be part of the Yugoslavian union. Once famous as a tourist resort, Croatia decided to remake itself as a war-torn, shell-pocked no-man's land. American troops were deployed here in an effort to stop the fighting.</p><p>Previous to the war not one single American knew Croatia existed.</p><p>To locate Croatia on a map, find the heel of Italy’s boot and then cross that skinny bit of water. You’re there. Note how close it really is to the heart of Western "Old Europe." Now you understand why a little genocide here received so much attention (not to mention money and ordinance) while a similar genocide in far-off Africa is lucky if someone in the West bothers to not give a damn.</p><h3>Slovenia:</h3><p>Was also once part of Yugoslavia. Various conquerors and empires have taken it over, but it was never one of those places the Habsburgs really bragged about. Ernest Hemmingway--Slovenia's most famous son--drove an ambulance there during World War I. In the Yugoslavian collapse, while everyone else (Croatia included) indulged in some ethnic cleansing, Slovenia blocked off the roads and took a nap. Famous for painted beehive panels, which are available at every tourist shop.</p><h3>Prague:</h3><p>isn’t a country. It also isn’t part of Czechoslovakia, because Czechoslovakia pulled a Yugoslavia broke apart. The resulting splinter nations--The Czech Republic and, cunningly, Slovakia--never did get into much of a war, never hosted American troops and thus, according to the Bosnia-Croatia Rule of Foreign Relevancy (also known as the Vietnam Theory), Prague shouldn't exist, or, at the very least, it should be invisible to Americans. Except--and this is a big except--Prague has really, really cheap beer. American backpackers too cool for London and too cheap for Paris include it in their pilgrim’s path. British stag parties also descend here in perfidious, drunken hordes, proving (reassuringly, I think) that Americans are nowhere near the world’s most obnoxious tourists. Actually, that honor would have to go to certain Aussies. Those who are drunk by breakfast.</p><h3>Later:</h3><p>Relevant lessons building on this lecture.</p>&#13; &#13;</div>&#13;<div class="footnoteCollection col-xs-12 col-ms-2 col-sm-offset-2 col-sm-8" data-footnote-collection="3">&#13;<ul class="footnotes"></ul>&#13;</div>&#13; &#13; &#13; &#13;<div class="socialButtons col-xs-12">&#13; <a onclick="window.open('http://twitter.com/share?text=' + encodeURIComponent('') + ' %7C A short story by Zachary Bell %7C via @zachary_bell &amp;url=http://bit.ly/1X5jrE1', 'windowOpenTab', 'width=600,height=450,left=100, top=100'); return false" href=""><span class="icon-twitter"></span></a>&#13; <a onclick="window.open('http://reddit.com/submit?url=http://www.zacharybell.net/blog/index.html&amp;title=' + encodeURIComponent(''), 'windowOpenTab', 'width=1000,height=600,left=100, top=100'); return false" href=""><span class="icon-reddit"></span></a>&#13; <a onclick="window.open('https://www.facebook.com/dialog/feed?app_id=1175371049143599&amp;display=popup&amp;caption=An%20example%20caption&amp;link=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.facebook.com%2Fdocs%2F&amp;redirect_uri=https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer'&#13;&#10;, 'windowOpenTab', 'width=600,height=600,left=100, top=100'); return false" href=""><span class="icon-facebook"></span></a>&#13; <a onclick="window.location.href = 'mailto:?subject=' + encodeURIComponent('') + '%3A%20A%20short%20story%20by%20Zachary%20Bell&amp;body=' + encodeURIComponent('') + '%0A%0A http://bit.ly/1X5jrE1'; return false" href=""><span class="icon-mail"></span></a>&#13;</div>&#13; &#13; &#13; &#13; &#13; &#13;</div>&#13; &#13; &#13;<div class="entryWrapper row">&#13;<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-offset-2 col-sm-10">&#13; <a href="http://www.zacharybell.net/blog/2015-02-09-innocents-still-abroad.html">&#13;<h2 class="title">Innocents Still Abroad</h2>&#13;</a>&#13;</div>&#13; &#13;<div class="story col-xs-12 col-ms-offset-1 col-ms-10 col-sm-offset-2 col-sm-8" data-story-number="4">&#13;<p>I went to Turkey with a headfull of American ideas about Islam.</p><p>Not long after we arrived the afternoon call to prayer came up on the speakers under the Blue Mosque and—after being startled by how <em>loud</em> the chanting really is—we smiled amongst ourselves and thought yes, we expected that. So profound was our understanding of this place and its religion that we waited for everyone to…do something. Roll out their rugs and get to praying? Instead we got nothing. Not one Turk on the street even glanced in the direction of the mosque.</p><p>Hmmm. Ok. Well, Turkey is officially a secular state, one with an eye towards membership in the European Union and Istanbul is the fifth largest city in the world. Any urban area that size will be less devout than the countryside.</p><p>Still, not so much as a twitch. Orange juice vendors went right on yelling random English catchphrases at us. Taxi drivers continued their honking. Despite the omnipresent ghost howling from a hundred minarets, Istanbul was pretty much just another European city. This made sense.</p><p>Then, closer to the Blue Mosque, which is among the most important sites in all Islam, we started to see women in headscarves, or even burkas. Ahh, we thought, here we see that there really are differences. No woman walked alone and they usually followed a pace or two behind their men. The women in our own group, western girls led by the light of a burning bra, shook their heads and said never, never and we felt better because here were things as we expected them to be.</p><p>For a while. Istanbul is very, very big. Cross the Bosporus into the New City, where the various mosques are just round humps on the skyline, and people jam the streets shoulder to shoulder, choking off motor traffic, a solid carpet of humanity lining the valleys between buildings. Here, women walk through the throng with their heads uncovered with not a single headscarf in sight. Women, unescorted, in jeans. Women yelling into cellphones with flashy, oversized handbags on their arms. It’s impossible to differentiate them from the jeans-wearing-purse-toting-cellphone-shouting women of any other country.</p><p>It occurred to us that the Blue Mosque was, in addition to a holy site, also a tourist destination and that many of the devout families we had seen were likely tourists themselves, from countries that took their Islam a little more seriously than urbanite Turks. Bumpkins come to the big city.</p><p>Then consider this: one of the calls to prayer occurs at around four thirty in the morning. I mentioned how loud the chanting is, but the call is downright terrifying when the disembodied voice barrels into your room, in the dark, yanking you up out of sleep. What would happen if the Pope were to start yodeling into every window on Manhattan at four thirty in the morning? The mayor would declare God dead and the city council would have every belfry on the island castrated. So why do the Turks, who evidently don’t care to pray, tolerate such an obnoxious alarm clock? How can something seemingly irrelevant still sculpt their existence so completely?</p><p>Thomas Jefferson wrote that travel makes a man wiser, but less happy. The latter half of that statement is definitely true. I’ve seen billboards in Cambodia pleading—in English—that visitors refrain from having sex with Cambodian children and this right outside the entrance to the Siem Reap airport. Welcome to Cambodia, please no kiddie diddling. I’ve seen those aforementioned children shitting in the middle of the street like dogs. I’ve also sat on a whisper-silent train in Switzerland or talked healthcare with a Frenchman and realized that our City on the Hill is, perhaps, just a ho-hum, middle-of-the-road, it’ll-do sort of place.</p><p>So yes, travel has undermined my contentment. But wiser? I go to Turkey and I realize that at least a big portion of the Muslim population is ambivalent about their religion and mostly they are like everyone else and yet somehow these people are the face of our unknown enemy and we are their Great Satan for reasons just as illusionary. What is anyone supposed to make of all this information? That nothing makes any sense and never will? The more you know the less you understand? Can that possibly pass for wisdom?</p><p>Give me a foe, or a friend, but don’t give me a reflection of my confused self.</p>&#13; &#13;</div>&#13;<div class="footnoteCollection col-xs-12 col-ms-2 col-sm-offset-2 col-sm-8" data-footnote-collection="4">&#13;<ul class="footnotes"></ul>&#13;</div>&#13; &#13; &#13; &#13;<div class="socialButtons col-xs-12">&#13; <a onclick="window.open('http://twitter.com/share?text=' + encodeURIComponent('') + ' %7C A short story by Zachary Bell %7C via @zachary_bell &amp;url=http://bit.ly/1X5jrE1', 'windowOpenTab', 'width=600,height=450,left=100, top=100'); return false" href=""><span class="icon-twitter"></span></a>&#13; <a onclick="window.open('http://reddit.com/submit?url=http://www.zacharybell.net/blog/index.html&amp;title=' + encodeURIComponent(''), 'windowOpenTab', 'width=1000,height=600,left=100, top=100'); return false" href=""><span class="icon-reddit"></span></a>&#13; <a onclick="window.open('https://www.facebook.com/dialog/feed?app_id=1175371049143599&amp;display=popup&amp;caption=An%20example%20caption&amp;link=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.facebook.com%2Fdocs%2F&amp;redirect_uri=https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer'&#13;&#10;, 'windowOpenTab', 'width=600,height=600,left=100, top=100'); return false" href=""><span class="icon-facebook"></span></a>&#13; <a onclick="window.location.href = 'mailto:?subject=' + encodeURIComponent('') + '%3A%20A%20short%20story%20by%20Zachary%20Bell&amp;body=' + encodeURIComponent('') + '%0A%0A http://bit.ly/1X5jrE1'; return false" href=""><span class="icon-mail"></span></a>&#13;</div>&#13; &#13; &#13; &#13; &#13; &#13;</div>&#13; &#13; &#13;<div class="entryWrapper row">&#13;<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-offset-2 col-sm-10">&#13; <a href="http://www.zacharybell.net/blog/2015-02-09-the-things-we-have-in-our-freezer.html">&#13;<h2 class="title">The Things We Have In Our Freezer</h2>&#13;</a>&#13;</div>&#13; &#13;<div class="story col-xs-12 col-ms-offset-1 col-ms-10 col-sm-offset-2 col-sm-8" data-story-number="5">&#13;<p>Frozen breast milk, a large bottle of gin and nothing else.

I lieu of cars, they make do with a what-else-you-gonna-do sort of pragmatism that often ends in frostbite.</p><p>Though some people have to peddle through malarial heat instead of snow.</p><p>Or walk because they can't afford a bicycle.</p><p>And the swamp/mountain pass between their home and the place they work might be held by a rebel group.</p><p>That rebel group's child soldiers might be high on ten kinds of crack and looking to rape just anything that comes within raping distance.</p><p>On the post-rape leg of the journey, there might be an IED planted in the gutter.</p><p>But before they get exploded by the IED, a Predator might mistake them for a tango and the bicycle (that they might not have) for an RPG.<footnote>Prior to the War on Terror™, that sentence would have made zero sense.</footnote></p><p>Which might not actually cut their lives all that short because they might have AIDS and malaria both, with no access to any sort of medical treatment.</p><p>The things I am actually cultivating:</p><p>1) A ratty fringe of hair on my upper lip.</p><p>2) A bizarre sort of non-sexual masochism.</p>&#13; &#13;</div>&#13;<div class="footnoteCollection col-xs-12 col-ms-2 col-sm-offset-2 col-sm-8" data-footnote-collection="6">&#13;<ul class="footnotes"></ul>&#13;</div>&#13; &#13; &#13; &#13;<div class="socialButtons col-xs-12">&#13; <a onclick="window.open('http://twitter.com/share?text=' + encodeURIComponent('') + ' %7C A short story by Zachary Bell %7C via @zachary_bell &amp;url=http://bit.ly/1X5jrE1', 'windowOpenTab', 'width=600,height=450,left=100, top=100'); return false" href=""><span class="icon-twitter"></span></a>&#13; <a onclick="window.open('http://reddit.com/submit?url=http://www.zacharybell.net/blog/index.html&amp;title=' + encodeURIComponent(''), 'windowOpenTab', 'width=1000,height=600,left=100, top=100'); return false" href=""><span class="icon-reddit"></span></a>&#13; <a onclick="window.open('https://www.facebook.com/dialog/feed?app_id=1175371049143599&amp;display=popup&amp;caption=An%20example%20caption&amp;link=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.facebook.com%2Fdocs%2F&amp;redirect_uri=https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer'&#13;&#10;, 'windowOpenTab', 'width=600,height=600,left=100, top=100'); return false" href=""><span class="icon-facebook"></span></a>&#13; <a onclick="window.location.href = 'mailto:?subject=' + encodeURIComponent('') + '%3A%20A%20short%20story%20by%20Zachary%20Bell&amp;body=' + encodeURIComponent('') + '%0A%0A http://bit.ly/1X5jrE1'; return false" href=""><span class="icon-mail"></span></a>&#13;</div>&#13; &#13; &#13; &#13; &#13; &#13;</div>&#13; &#13; &#13;<div class="entryWrapper row">&#13;<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-offset-2 col-sm-10">&#13; <a href="http://www.zacharybell.net/blog/2015-02-09-travelblog-2009.html">&#13;<h2 class="title">Travelblog</h2>&#13;</a>&#13;</div>&#13; &#13;<div class="story col-xs-12 col-ms-offset-1 col-ms-10 col-sm-offset-2 col-sm-8" data-story-number="7">&#13;<p>Whenever Hoss and I make plans to visit a timezone that experiences tomorrow before we do, someone always asks why. As in, “why would you want to go to <em>there</em>?” spoken in the same tone you'd ask a guy planning to plug his schlong into an electrical socket why he hated living so much. So why? Why travel? Though I know the question is generally asked in the spirit of purest xenophobia, it’s still valid.</p><p>I don’t have an answer.</p><p>As previously mentioned, travel doesn’t provide much in the way of enlightenment. It has a certain sexiness among other travelers, but friends, neighbors and coworkers are rarely impressed. Travel wont earn you a promotion, nor does it broadcast in high definition.</p><p>So why?</p><p>I usually tell people I travel because catching whatever local disease (or falling victim to whatever violent splinter group) builds character. And what the hell, it gives me a chance to take pictures of something that isn’t my dog.</p><p>Why not Cabo?</p><p>Why Siagon instead of the Bahamas?</p><p>Why seek discomfort?</p><p>Again, I don't know. Serious travelers are always looking for a bigger fix. You been to Prague? Dubrovnik? Boy that ain’t <em>shit</em>. This Swiss bastard over here, he just got back from Nauru, a country so small that just by his being there the human population doubled. Next year he’s joining an expedition to the center of the motherfucking earth. So there’s obviously a measure of dick-thumping involved. I’m not immune. Once upon a time Paris spiked my tourist meter; it had the Eiffel tower and a cathedral made of bones. Now? Slovenia looks like Austria, which looks like Germany, which looks like the insides of a WalMart. If you’ve ever wondered what would inspire a person to summit Everest, this is the reason: to one up that Swiss bastard.</p><p>Which is stupid. Who can even remember the Swiss bastard’s name, let alone inform him that he's been usurped?</p><p>I always return from these expeditions discontented and confused. We spend thousands of dollars for what eventually percolates down to a handful of memories and maybe a good anecdote. Spain is sangria by that bridge they threw revolutionaries off of. Italy is that guy shouting “sonofabeecha!” in the middle of the night. Cambodia is a heat, a hunger and butterflies. Turkey will be tea and learning to play backgammon. Little things that don’t even matter.</p><p>But they do matter. We start out in this life muscle and sinews, but we leave it as a collection of memories. Travel fills some of those spans inside of me that would otherwise be just a white noise of time spent doing nothing much. I know of no more reliable way to turn dollars in to pieces of myself.</p>&#13; &#13;</div>&#13;<div class="footnoteCollection col-xs-12 col-ms-2 col-sm-offset-2 col-sm-8" data-footnote-collection="7">&#13;<ul class="footnotes"></ul>&#13;</div>&#13; &#13; &#13; &#13;<div class="socialButtons col-xs-12">&#13; <a onclick="window.open('http://twitter.com/share?text=' + encodeURIComponent('') + ' %7C A short story by Zachary Bell %7C via @zachary_bell &amp;url=http://bit.ly/1X5jrE1', 'windowOpenTab', 'width=600,height=450,left=100, top=100'); return false" href=""><span class="icon-twitter"></span></a>&#13; <a onclick="window.open('http://reddit.com/submit?url=http://www.zacharybell.net/blog/index.html&amp;title=' + encodeURIComponent(''), 'windowOpenTab', 'width=1000,height=600,left=100, top=100'); return false" href=""><span class="icon-reddit"></span></a>&#13; <a onclick="window.open('https://www.facebook.com/dialog/feed?app_id=1175371049143599&amp;display=popup&amp;caption=An%20example%20caption&amp;link=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.facebook.com%2Fdocs%2F&amp;redirect_uri=https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer'&#13;&#10;, 'windowOpenTab', 'width=600,height=600,left=100, top=100'); return false" href=""><span class="icon-facebook"></span></a>&#13; <a onclick="window.location.href = 'mailto:?subject=' + encodeURIComponent('') + '%3A%20A%20short%20story%20by%20Zachary%20Bell&amp;body=' + encodeURIComponent('') + '%0A%0A http://bit.ly/1X5jrE1'; return false" href=""><span class="icon-mail"></span></a>&#13;</div>&#13; &#13; &#13; &#13; &#13; &#13;</div>&#13; &#13; &#13;<div class="entryWrapper row">&#13;<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-offset-2 col-sm-10">&#13; <a href="http://www.zacharybell.net/blog/2015-02-23-moving.html">&#13;<h2 class="title">Moving</h2>&#13;</a>&#13;</div>&#13; &#13;<div class="story col-xs-12 col-ms-offset-1 col-ms-10 col-sm-offset-2 col-sm-8" data-story-number="8">&#13;<p>We are in the process of moving house. The large items--furniture, vacuum cleaners--have been taken care of and now it comes down to the little, revelatory things. The things I was unaware I owned. I find myself walking down a public sidewalk holding a dirty sponge mop, a stack of CDs, a print of Ansel Adams' cactus and a single infant-sized sock that has somehow wandered off from the herd and I wonder how it happens. How do I come into possession of all of these useless things? Why, once I have them, are they impossible to escape?</p><p>I mop--on the rare occasion that I mop--with a towel and a bucket of soapy water. The sponge-headed fellow spends all its time lurking in the closet, like a mildewed plague-carrier. I don't own a CD player. I think the Xbox might be able to play them, but I don't care to find out because my phone plays MP3s. Though I respect his efforts to further photography as an artform, I've never really liked Ansel Adams.<footnote><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/Ansel_Adams_-_National_Archives_79-AA-N03.jpg">It's a picture of a cactus, people</a>.</footnote>Babies can't walk, they don't wear shoes and there has never been a sock invented that will stay on those tiny feet anyway. Yet all of these things, and hundreds of similarly useless objects, have followed me from one abode to the next.</p><p>More though, stuff simply expands to fill all available space. I once owned a ten-car garage. It was a 1,800 square foot hanger. Empty, it had an echo and, like, interior weather patterns.</p><p>We managed to stuff it completely. Nine leaky garden hoses. Traffic cones. An full-sized anatomy skeleton. Four motorcycles, none running. A dozen Jeep doors, most of them left side doors. Dead plants, paint cans, bottle rockets in a plastic sack. A Taco Bell trashcan. We needed none of it, and yet we had it.</p><p>Now we live in a much smaller place. We don't even have a garage; the yard is about the size of a picnic blanket. Yet even after purging and downsizing, we still possess so much stuff that it took almost a week to move it all ten blocks north.</p><p>Someday I will move into a yurt--a condo of a yurt, a studio apartment of a yurt--that doesn't have space for all that stuff and I will be able to list every single thing I own. I will name every object in my yurt. I will talk to those objects. Remember, Pr0ny the Laptop, when we used to be burdened by possessions? Remember, Sitty the Chair, how we found that entire bag of Valentines Day-themed stuffed animals and couldn't even remember where they came from? Much better, Eaty the Plate, now that we're out here on the steppes. Much better, Shavy the razor. Much better.</p>&#13; &#13;</div>&#13;<div class="footnoteCollection col-xs-12 col-ms-2 col-sm-offset-2 col-sm-8" data-footnote-collection="8">&#13;<ul class="footnotes"></ul>&#13;</div>&#13; &#13; &#13; &#13;<div class="socialButtons col-xs-12">&#13; <a onclick="window.open('http://twitter.com/share?text=' + encodeURIComponent('') + ' %7C A short story by Zachary Bell %7C via @zachary_bell &amp;url=http://bit.ly/1X5jrE1', 'windowOpenTab', 'width=600,height=450,left=100, top=100'); return false" href=""><span class="icon-twitter"></span></a>&#13; <a onclick="window.open('http://reddit.com/submit?url=http://www.zacharybell.net/blog/index.html&amp;title=' + encodeURIComponent(''), 'windowOpenTab', 'width=1000,height=600,left=100, top=100'); return false" href=""><span class="icon-reddit"></span></a>&#13; <a onclick="window.open('https://www.facebook.com/dialog/feed?app_id=1175371049143599&amp;display=popup&amp;caption=An%20example%20caption&amp;link=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.facebook.com%2Fdocs%2F&amp;redirect_uri=https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer'&#13;&#10;, 'windowOpenTab', 'width=600,height=600,left=100, top=100'); return false" href=""><span class="icon-facebook"></span></a>&#13; <a onclick="window.location.href = 'mailto:?subject=' + encodeURIComponent('') + '%3A%20A%20short%20story%20by%20Zachary%20Bell&amp;body=' + encodeURIComponent('') + '%0A%0A http://bit.ly/1X5jrE1'; return false" href=""><span class="icon-mail"></span></a>&#13;</div>&#13; &#13; &#13; &#13; &#13; &#13;</div>&#13; &#13; &#13;<div class="entryWrapper row">&#13;<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-offset-2 col-sm-10">&#13; <a href="http://www.zacharybell.net/blog/2015-9-07-by-way-of-announcement-a-txt-conversation.html">&#13;<h2 class="title">By Way Of Announcement, A TXT Conversation</h2>&#13;</a>&#13;</div>&#13; &#13;<div class="story col-xs-12 col-ms-offset-1 col-ms-10 col-sm-offset-2 col-sm-8" data-story-number="9">&#13;<p>A true an accurate transcript of an important event transcribed in the vernacular of our day for the edification and amusement of internet passers-by.</p><p>Iz bby, c?</p><p>(10/5/10 10:54am) J: Norbles (10/5/10 10:54am) J: Her name is Norbles Aubrels Bellugles (10/5/10 10:54am) J: How much does it weigh?
