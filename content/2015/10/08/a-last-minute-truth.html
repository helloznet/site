On screen, noble doctors scrambled to save a girl on the operating table. There had been an accident. Eustace, stone-deaf and mostly disinterested couldn’t hope to keep pace with the show’s dialog, but that didn’t matter. Cutting someone open. Running around. Crying. Sneaking into the supply closet for a tryst. The doctors on TV inhabited a world filled with motion, whereas Eustace’s world—which was not the real world, but instead something called Lutheran Eldercare—stood silent and still.</p><p>In the far corner of the room, lying entombed in a state-issued hospital bed, Eustace’s roommate—Joe, by name, comatose by trade—groaned in his sleep and shifted restlessly. Eustace squinted over at the enshrouded form, waiting for the inevitable. Then it came. Joe farted, a low, wet flapper. Only time would tell if he had shit himself again.</p><p>“Stoppit, you son of a bitch!” Eustace growled—nearly sobbed—as the fart started to stink.</p><p>Joe and Eustace had bunked together for a few years now, but Eustace didn’t really know the man, because the man was gone. Joseph Montgomery entertained his last rational thought right around the turn of the century. He could walk and talk some, but mostly he stayed in bed, rotated every once in a while like a pig over a fire to stave off bedsores. That was fine. Eustace preferred a quiet roommate. Unfortunately, Joe, no longer a citizen of Coherent, had little control over the delivery of his mail. The orderlies cleaned him up eventually, but only in their own sweet time. Meanwhile, Eustace got to sit there in a fog of Joe’s guts.</p><p>All the more reason.</p><p>The doctor program went to commercial and Eustace reached surreptitiously under the recliner for the bottle of whiskey. The orderlies didn’t know about the booze and they surely didn’t know he had the gun, or they would have taken both away from him before he could say “God bless Betty Ford.” Keeping quiet. That was the secret here in the Eldercare. Keep quiet and they’ll be happy to ignore you forever. Joe, who had shit himself and in grand fashion, was proof of that; he only complained rectally, and nobody ever bothered him.</p><p>“You stinking son of a bitch!” Eustace yodeled.</p><p>Right after the show. Time to go. Way past time. Eustace glanced at the clock. Ten forty-five in the morning. Another fifteen minutes.</p><p>The door to the outside hall stood open and Eustace wanted it that way, so nothing would muffle his final word, but an open door also required prudence. He got the remote and fumbled the television’s volume way down, listening for the squeak of orderly shoe on tile. Satisfied that Ricky or one of his henchmen wasn’t going to walk by, Eustace reached a shriveled paw into the recliner’s elasticized pouch, where the pistol waited. His fingers crawled across the hammer and the barrel and over the dimples of the cylinder. This wasn’t the way he would have chosen, but it would do. He pulled the pistol free and set it in his lap.</p><p>The gun was an Colt Single Action Army, a Peacemaker, once owned by Eustace’s father. An antique and probably valuable, but never once in the seventy-odd years since he had inherited the thing had Eustace considered selling it, even during some hard, hard times. Maybe he’d always known there would be a use for it at the end of a whole stack of decades.</p><p>Ten till the hour.</p><p>Eustace reached back into the recliner’s pouch for the ammo. The cardboard carton was old and frayed white around the corners, but the blunt rounds inside shone clean and brass-bright. He’d kept the carton dry and cool, first in the back of a closet at home and then wrapped in a ball of his own boxer shorts when they deported him to the Eldercare. The Peacemaker itself wanted for oil, but still operated smoothly enough.</p><p>He pulled the hammer back to half-cock and liked the sound. The gate came open smoothly and he thumbed in the first bullet with a shaking hand. He skipped the next chamber and fed four more rounds to the gun. Never give a Peacemaker the full six rounds. Five was enough. His daddy had taught him that. Eustace dropped the gun back onto his lap and resumed watching television.</p><p>Joe let fly again, a high, jaunty whistle that should have set the bastard’s bed sheets to flapping. Eustace had long ago dubbed that particular cannonade “the brass band,” as opposed to the subtler, but far nastier “angry crocodile.”</p><p>Oh lordy look what he had been reduced to.</p><p>After what seemed like a hell of a long time, the doctors on finally saved the girl’s life and the credits came up. Staring fixedly at the television, Eustace groped around in his lap until he found the gun. It was heavier than it should be. His chicken arms shook from the effort but the gun stayed where it was. A bank commercial came up, starring a goofy guy in a polo shirt who walked through a mountain meadow while yammering on about home loans and free checking.</p><p>Eustace glared at the television, giving it the same look Joe got for farting. The bank had been where things started going bad. He had wanted to open his own repair shop and the bank had been happy to give him a loan, hadn’t they? Real happy. But when things went sour—this had been in the early sixties—that goddamned bank had come and taken his house. He and Shirley moved into a rented trailer and he had to start working for that prick, Ernie, again. Life never did get back to right.</p><p>And here he was, stuck in this shit-befouled, pauper purgatory where the pills came every three hours and the television only went to sleep when the inmates did.</p><p>Eustace pointed his pistol at the goofy fellow with the polo shirt and the free checking. He pulled the hammer back to full-cock and again he liked the authoritative click it made settling into place. He pulled the trigger. The Peacemaker's hammer fell on the empty chamber Joe hadn't loaded with a dry, businesslike snap and he grinned. When they came and took his house away from him, he had stood by docile as a mule and then he’d spent most of his life turning a wrench under someone else’s car for the price of a hamburger or two an hour. He’d done it for the kids, and for Shirley, and that’d been right and maybe he didn’t regret it, exactly, but Shirley was long dead, same deal with his youngest son, the only one of the three that had ever been worth a damn. The other two, both of them old men in their own rights, never called and never wrote and had left him in this place without so much as a fare-thee-well.</p><p>What did that leave? Nothing, hence the Peacemaker. And it would make peace, Eustace had no doubts on that count.</p><p>But a man ought to use what freedom he was allowed.</p><p>Eustace glanced out the door. Still no Ricky. That fatso was probably at the end of the hall, watching television in the orderly station. Eustace checked the wall clock, hanging above some Christmas cards from Joe’s niece and nephew. Just past eleven in the morning. Ricky wouldn’t make his rounds until noon, when it was time to deliver lunch and meds. Eustace sat, fiddling with the gun and waiting for his passing thought to assemble itself into a course of action.</p><p>Yes, by God. A better way.</p><p>First things first, he needed to pry himself out of the chair. He positioned each limb just so and then, after an assessment of leverage, weights and air resistance he hoisted himself—carefully!—up, creakingly aware that his hip not only could snap on him, but actually relished the idea.</p><p>Eventually Eustace attained a state of upright and shuffled over to the closet, stripping out of his robe as he went. Underneath, he was buck-assed naked, beyond a pair of socks and his slippers, but if that offended Joe, well, Joe shit himself. On the way across the room, Eustace happened to catch a reflection in the bathroom mirror. His body sagged where it hadn’t mummified. He could see his actual self under that mess though, handsome, with a dimpled chin and a pair of green eyes that used to put the leg-spreading voodoo on the ladies. Or maybe he could only remember remembering that face.</p><p>At the closet, Eustace decided on his suit. He might as well make this a formal occasion. Starting with underwear, working ponderously, he got the suit on (worn only to funerals in recent years) and finished with a red bow tie Shirley used to like. She said he looked natty in it and natty was hunky-dory.</p><p>Dressed, Eustace put his robe back on and wrapped it tight. Ricky and the other orderlies expected their inmates to wear the proper uniform at all times. That Eustace had had his best wingtips on, not to mention a fine wool suit, didn’t matter a tittle, so long as he had the robe.</p><p>He had to move fast now; if he slowed down, this craziness might drain out of him and that would be a shame. He reached in under the robe and under the jacket of his suit and shoved the gun into the waistband of his pants. It was a stupid way to carry a loaded firearm around—unless he was aiming to blow his balls off—but stupid was the order of the day.</p><p>Armed and dressed, Eustace hopped over to the door and grabbed an envelope tacked to the bulletin board next to it. Some MediCare thing his son wanted him to sign. Eustace didn’t know what the papers signified, nor did he care. What mattered is that it had the ungrateful bastard’s return address on the envelope. Eustace shoved the whole wad into his robe pocket and stepped out into the hallway.</p><p>Ricky was indeed at the orderly’s station, watching the television and shoving Cheetos down his gaping, hippo mouth.</p><p>“Morning,” Ricky grunted. He didn’t stand up, but he did take his feet off the desk.</p><p>Eustace nodded, keeping his head down. He wanted to appear good and zombie-like.</p><p>“Going for a walk there, buddy?” Ricky said.</p><p>“Sure,” Eustace mumbled, “Stretch my legs.”</p><p>“Don’t get into any trouble.”</p><p>Ricky went back to the television and Eustace continued his hobble down the hallway. Upon opening the front door (Mother Mary, how did something so simple get to be such a struggle?) and stepping out into the late November sunshine, Eustace was struck with that prisoner’s awe at the size of the outside world. His life was spent in hibernation; whole days passed without him moving any further than the bathroom. Now cars zoomed past every-which-way and even the wind struck him as a trifle intimidating. A helicopter flew overhead. Eustace shivered.</p><p>The corner store, Eustace’s first destination, was a few blocks up from the Eldercare, quite a walk, but he managed, even doffing an imaginary hat to a pretty girl. Despite his being dried Methuselah in a bathrobe, she smiled at him and waved, laughing.</p><p>A bell above the door jangled as Eustace maneuvered into the corner store.</p><p>“Good morning,” the fat woman at the counter said, looking at Eustace’s bathrobe with one eyebrow cocked.</p><p>“Mornin!” Eustace said, beaming. He went over to the counter and pulled a ten dollar bill from the pocket of his robe. The Eldercare received his government check directly, on the assumption he had become too addlebrained to pay the rent on his own.</p><p>“What can I do for you?” the fat woman said.</p><p>“Smokes,” Eustace barked, scanning the shelves myopically.</p><p>“Smokes huh? What kind?”</p><p>Eustace checked his memory. He’d had a brand once, before he’d stopped smoking in…whenever he’d stopped smoking, which had been a long time ago. Sunbeam or Dancer or…hell.</p><p>“Luckies,” he said. They weren’t his brand, but they should have been. Only a man afraid of death would pussyfoot around with filters.</p><p>“Lucky Strike?”</p><p>“Those are them,” Eustace agreed.</p><p>The clerk found a pack and set it on the counter. It was covered in a light robe of dust.</p><p>“Got some matches, too?”</p><p>“I think so. Somewhere.”</p><p>“How much?”</p><p>“Them cigarettes are four dollars. The matches are free.”</p><p>“Good. Can I get a paper bag?”</p><p>The clerk produced a tiny bag that was just barely big enough for the deck of smokes. Eustace shook his head. “Bigger bag. Biggest you got.”</p><p>“How is this?” she said, holding up a full-sized paper grocery bag.</p><p>“Bingo!” Eustace said, pulling his lips back from a picket of yellowed, but mostly present, teeth.</p><p>Eustace picked up the cigarettes and dropped them into the pocket of his robe along with the matches, then took the empty bag and tucked it under his arm. The clerk raised her eyebrow again, but made change without comment.</p><p>“You have a good day,” Eustace said, shuffling to the door. The fat woman watched him go, put the ten dollar bill into her register and gently closed the drawer.</p><p>Outside, Eustace veered off into the alley running between the corner store and its nearest neighbor. When he was sure no one could see him, he struggled out of his robe and dropped the filthy old thing on the ground like a shed skin, and then pulled the pistol out of the waistband of his pants. He considered the gun for a moment, before dropping it into the paper bag. He folded the bag over twice, so it made a tidy little package, and tucked it under his arm. The remaining money, the envelope with his son’s address on it and the Luckies went into the breast pocket of his jacket.</p><p>There was a bus stop directly across from the corner store. Eustace hobbled over to the shelter and had himself a seat on the bench. While he waited, he peeled the wrapper off his Luckies and pulled one of the shorter-than-normal cigarettes out, relishing the good, earthy smell of tobacco. There had been a reason he’d quit, but damned if he could remember it. He had a head full of holes like that, places where important information should be, but wasn’t. You got used to it, after a while.</p><p>Eustace stuck the cancer stick in his mouth. It took him three tries to strike a match—his hands had a hard time with fine tasks—but when the first, trembling inhalation made the effort worthwhile. He leaned back and watched a pair of sparrows bicker in a winter-bare bush nearby. Scummy gray snow from the storm a few days back lined the gutters, and the sun, while warm against his face, had that peculiar winter hardness to it. He took another long drag, and then blew out. That made him cough for almost a full minute, but by God, it still felt good.</p><p>He got onto the first bus that happened by. The driver told him to lose the cigarette, which he did, and then Eustace took out his envelope and asked the man how to find the address written thereon. The driver gave him a long explanation, but Eustace didn’t bother paying attention. All that mattered was that he was headed in the right direction.</p><p>Two hours and three transfers later, Eustace stepped off a different bus in an unfamiliar neighborhood. Big, new houses squatted on tiny lots like a row of bulldogs all shitting on napkins. His useless elder son was living the American dream.</p><p>Eustace patted himself down (cigarettes: check, bag with pistol: check), pulled the envelope out of his pocket, and started walking. At each house along the street, he shuffled up, peered at the address until it came into reasonable focus, checked the envelope again and then moved on. It took him half an hour to traverse the three blocks between the bus stop and the porch of what he hoped was Useless Son’s house. Useless Son as opposed to Drunken Son or Dead Son.</p><p>By then, Eustace was literally panting, his tongue poking over his lower lip like a dried-up tuber. He double-double-checked the envelope. Looked at the numbers by the house’s door. A definite match.</p><p>Eustace celebrated by sitting on the front step. It was about one in the afternoon, maybe two. He looked up and down the street, wondering at the complete and total stillness. Not so much as a housecat. No sign of life from inside either. Where were Useless Son and the Skinny Harpy? Eustace didn’t know. Useless Son was in the far reaches of sixty by now, and retired, so the little shit didn’t have anywhere in particular to be.</p><p>Maybe he was at the doctor.</p><p>That gave Eustace a thrill. Maybe Useless Son was discovering that old happened to everyone.</p><p>Or maybe they were inside, peeking out through the blinds while the Harpy called the Eldercare to come collect him.</p><p>Eustace’s heart had resumed its usual wheezing throb and his tongue once again fit into his mouth, where it belonged. He stood and made his way across the yard, towards the garage. It had two big doors, one for each of the two cars it could hold. Those doors would be hopeless. Even if they weren’t locked, Eustace lacked the strength to heft them up. But the garage had a side door, for people, not cars, around the corner. That door was locked. Eustace jiggled the handle, kicked it and even threw a shoulder against the door, trying to batter it down with his scarecrow bulk, but nothing happened.</p><p>“Ok. We’ll see. We’ll see,” Eustace said to the door, as he unfolded the paper bag from around the Peacemaker. Squinting and turning his face to the side, as if he were afraid the gun would slap him, Eustace pointed the gun just to the right of the doorknob and slowly squeezed the trigger. A brisk explosion, much louder than Eustace had expected, rolled up and down the street. The recoil staggered him back ten feet, but a hole, roughly the size and shape of a soup can, appeared in the door where the latch had formerly met frame.</p><p>Dogs all around the neighborhood raised an alarm. With the pistol’s kick still clanging his bones together like church bells, Eustace took a quick look at the streets—no cops, at least not yet—and tried the door. This time it swung politely open. Chuckling, Eustace stepped into the garage and laid eyes on his old girl.</p><p>She was a 1950 Mercury Monterrey, yard upon yard of Detroit steel. Not exactly in great shape—faded paint and a hardtop with only a few remaining scraps of vinyl—but doing no worse than Eustace himself. Purchased when he was thirty-seven years old, the car was what they would call a mid-life crisis purchase—or, one-third-of-life crisis, considering Eustace’s collection of years. He’d driven her up until…right around the time the red-faced President (Carter?) got his dick sucked by that fat…actress?</p><p>Anyway, rather than sell her, Eustace had grudgingly given the Merc over to Useless Son. Every time Useless Son showed up at the Eldercare (which was almost never), Eustace pestered him about the Merc. Keep her in a garage and be sure to give her some exercise now and again. Change the plugs, willya?</p><p>“Yeah, yeah, of course, pops,” Useless Son would say, “I’m taking care of it.”</p><p>Eustace half-believed the little fart had gone and sold his girl, but here she was.</p><p>Eustace ran a hand along the Merc’s curved, downward-sloping flank, taking in her crumpled fender and missing chrome. He opened her door and had a look inside, then walked around back and checked the plates. Licensed and everything, with some of those fancy classic car tags. Now it was only a matter of keys. Eustace bowed stiffly at the waist, like an English butler, and, propping himself carefully against the car’s black hide, felt around under the front wheel well, searching for the nifty magnetic hide-a-key key box he’d secreted away all those years ago. After just a few seconds of groping, he found it.</p><p>“Ha!” Eustace cackled, performing a shuffling two-step on the dusty concrete.</p><p>That left only one minor detail: escape. The garage came equipped with a door-opening gadget, but its operation escaped Eustace. And besides, a more direct solution presented itself.</p><p>Gun went back into paper sack. Paper sack went into car, on the passenger side of the bench seat. Then Eustace performed the complicated ritual of folding his antiquarian body into a sitting position behind the Merc’s wheel. From there, he had to stop and take stock. A long time ago, his body had been wired to perform all the actions required to start a car and get it moving, but now each step required conscious thought. Key went into ignition. One foot on the clutch, one on the gas, put her in reverse. Turn the key. On his first attempt, the car turned over, caught, but then his foot slipped off the clutch and the Merc lurched a few inches before dying.</p><p>“Drat,” Eustace muttered. He slapped the steering wheel and tried again. This time he got the Merc started and then let her sit for a minute, listening to the engine. A little rough, but who knew how old the gas was? That led him to another important question: how much gas? He bent over the wheel and peered at the gauge, which stood at just under a quarter of a tank. He tapped the glass over the needle with a thick fingernail, but the gauge stayed put.</p><p>Eustace grunted and revved the engine. Old or not, a Merc straight-six spoke with authority. With his face peeled back into a shit-eating grin, Eustace craned his head around, popped the clutch and slammed his foot down on the gas.</p><p>The engine roared and the Merc launched backwards, punching through the garage door like a linebacker through the paper banner at a homecoming game. Jagged spikes of wood blew out all across Useless Son’s driveway as the Merc hurtled towards the street. Eustace screamed and jabbed his foot down on the break. The car squealed. Stalled. Panting, but still wearing that grin, he sat and looked at the hole he’d left in Useless Son’s garage.</p><p>It would take more than a little plywood to patch that action up. Eustace poked his head out the window and looked back for damage on the Merc. A few scrapes, but nothing serious. The ruckus set all the neighborhood hounds off again, but there was still no activity on the street. No mothers poking their heads out of their doors, no children pointing. Eustace supposed all the mothers were at work, just like the fathers, and their kids would be at school or in cold-storage somewhere, waiting for someone to bail them out. That’s how the world ran these days.</p><p>Eustace restarted the Merc and tried easing her into motion, but working the clutch woke the arthritis in his hip and knee. It took him three more stalls to maneuver the car to the end of the driveway. By then he was starting to get the hang of driving again, never mind the red throb rolling up and down his left leg. The Merc pulled out onto the street smoothly enough. From there, he made three right turns at random, passing more of those identical bulldog houses. They said he was too old to drive, and they were right; his cataracts demoted everything, stop signs, trees and cars parked on the curbs, to fuzzy shadows, identifiable only by color. Even so, Eustace felt great. He couldn’t stop smiling.</p><p>But he needed a rest. His joints had unionized, led by his clutch-working knee, and were singing a high note. His breath came hard, the way he used to get after a hard day splitting logs.</p><p>Maintaining a wobbly fifteen, Eustace piloted the Merc down another six blocks, until he came to a neighborhood park. The Merc’s breaks moaned in protest as it came to a stop by the curb, in a patch of sun that beat nicely against the roof. Just a few minutes would do him up nicely. He swung his legs around and set them on the bench seat, the brown-bagged Peacemaker between his thighs. Stretched out, with his head resting on his suit coat, Eustace lit another Lucky and sighed out a streamer of smoke, watching the play of sun against bare branch in the tree above. Within seconds, he was asleep.</p><p>As he slept, he dreamed. Of Shirley, his wife. Of a Mexican whore who had gotten him drunk, given a tepid hand job and then stolen his wallet. He dreamed of other things too—all of it was disjointed. Wrenches that wouldn't turn the bolt. A Cheshire grin. The smell of cigars.</p><p>Then the whore, wiggling, giggling, paid for. Artifice. Artifice and not even that much of a pleasure, guilty or otherwise. But there’d been more than just the one, hadn’t there? Across the border into Juarez. Cheap as a dinner out and not one ever told him that he shouldn’t or that he should.</p><p>Some how all of that dissolved into a new scene: Shirley and that whore, both of them, sitting on a couch and talking about him, like he wasn’t there, but he was, he could hear. What if it doesn't work out? Shirley asked, How will he feed his children? The whore shook her head, her fat, powdered jowls wagging their disappointment.</p><p>Eustace woke up slowly and when his eyes finally opened, he felt far worse than he had pre-nap. His body had gummed up, like tired machinery filled with clotted grease. The cigarette had burned down between his fingers. He threw it out the open window and winched himself upright, using the door handle and the emergency brake for leverage. The sun still hovered well above the horizon, but its warmth was gone.</p><p>Eustace started the car and pulled away from the curb with a jerk. As he drove, he tried to figure out if he was afraid or not. Something squirmed in his guts, but he couldn’t name it.</p><p>Heading generally north, he found a major road and took it. Cars passed by on the left in a steady stream and he found himself leaning forward, practically up to the windshield, trying to bring the moving shapes into some kind of focus. A truck behind him honked and flashed the high beams, before swerving into the other lane. The driver leaned out the window and shouted.</p><p>Eustace drove for about twenty minutes, his hands tight on the wheel. That building excitement, something like the urge to urinate, percolated in his belly. Finally, he found what he was looking for and pulled off the road into a large parking lot. He found a space up near the building and set the emergency brake, but left the car running. These things followed a certain protocol. He looked at the sign in front of the Merc. Handicap only. Well, he didn’t have the tag to hang from the Merc’s rearview any more than he had the state’s permission to operate a motor vehicle, but Eustace could think of a dozen ailments that qualified him for the cripple spot.</p><p>His hands shook badly as he unrolled the pistol from the paper bag, and not all of it was old-man palsy. The Peacemaker gleamed in the winter sunlight. He stared at it for a moment, then broke the ancient firearm open again and checked its rounds one by one. Five minus the one he’d fired into Useless Son’s garage door. He went through again, shaking each bullet out gun and onto the Merc’s seat. They made a musical sound bouncing into each other. He picked one up and held it a few inches from his crooked nose. His mouth worked absently as he pondered the bullet. One bullet. Just for him.</p><p>Eustace put the single round into the Peacemaker.</p><p>There were no guards. That came as a disappointment. In his memory, there was always a fat guy, or maybe an older fellow like himself, stationed just inside the doors, usually sitting on a stool and trying not to doze off. Missing guard aside, the place hardly even seemed like a bank. No marble, no high ceilings and if there was a vault, Eustace couldn’t see it. Just a long counter, a few cubicles and some bland, barely audible jazz. Ah, but nevermind.</p><p>The woman at the front desk smiled at Eustace as he passed. She had that patronizing smirk adults reserved for the very young or the very old. Eustace ignored her and made his way over to the courtesy stand near the tellers, where people could endorse their checks and tally up their deposits. He pulled a blank deposit slip from the stack and, using one of the bank’s pens-on-a-chain, he wrote out a short message, pausing for a moment while his moth-eaten brain tried to spell out “please.” There was an “a” in there somewhere, he thought, but couldn’t say for certain. Eventually, he scribbled over the whole word, deciding that the situation didn’t require that kind of civility anyway.</p><p>Satisfied with his note, Eustace shuffled over to the line of folks waiting for a teller. His left shoe tapped out a rhythm on the bank’s carpet. When it was finally his turn, Eustace went up to the teller—a cute little thing, or so he half-imagined, not being able to see her very well—and set his deposit slip out on the counter, along with the now-empty grocery bag, which had been tucked under his arm.</p><p>“What can I do for you, sir?” the girl said.</p><p>Eustace looked down the row of tellers and then over his shoulder at the other customers. He tapped the deposit slip. The girl looked at it and cocked her head. Even Eustace could see the shift in her expression, from perky to disbelief.</p><p>“Is this a joke?” she said.</p><p>Eustace shook his head.</p><p>“Sir…” the teller said, trailing off.</p><p>The next teller down, an older woman, sensed something amiss.</p><p>“Is there a problem, Heather?” the older woman said.</p><p>“Margaret, this man, he…”</p><p>Heather, the young teller, handed the note to Margaret. Margaret put on a pair of glasses that were hanging around her neck from a strand of plastic pearls and read the note. It took her a moment to decipher Eustace’s palsied chicken scratch, even though there was really only one thing a note like that could possibly say.</p><p>“Sir, this isn’t funny. Are you here with someone? Is someone supposed to be watching you?” Margaret said.</p><p>She thought he was senile. That really got Eustace’s goat. The deposit slip was perfectly clear, handwriting aside. He reached into his suit coat and grabbed hold of the blunderbuss concealed within. In his mind, the gun came free in one smooth motion, but somehow the sight at the end of the barrel got tangled in his waistband and refused to budge. The ladies gawked at him as he yanked, twisting his pants all out of whack. When the Peacemaker finally did come free, the front sight caught on his boxer shorts and jerked them up into his balls pretty good.</p><p>“Nuuugghn,” Eustace moaned, stumbling back from the counter and bringing the pistol up with one hand while the other fluttered down to his injured testicles. The Peacemaker hardly looked like a real firearm; it was too big, half a size out of scale with everything else in the room, including Eustace. Heather screamed and put her hands to her face, like a lady was supposed to when confronted by a mouse.</p><p>His balls hurt something fierce, but the old boys had stopped doing anything at all useful a long time ago, so he ignored them and kept his concentration on the tellers.</p><p>“Sir,” Margaret said, putting her hands on her hips, “you put that thing down right now.”</p><p>Eustace pulled the hammer back, pointed the Peacemaker at the ceiling and fired. There was a terrific crack and the ceiling tile above Eustace blew apart. White bits, like chunky snow, rained down on his shoulders. When the gunshot stopped ringing in his ears, the whole bank had gone utterly silent.</p><p>“Madam,” he said, his voice clear and strong, “put the money in the bag and no one gets hurt. Understand?”</p><p>Hadn’t he spent his whole life wanting to say those words in earnest, all the way back to the time he’d been old enough to point a finger and yell “stickemup!” Oh glory, it was fine.</p><p>“Do what the man says, Heather,” Margaret said, “just stay calm, sir, alright?”</p><p>Eustace was calm. He was also out of ammunition now, but Margaret didn’t know that.</p><p>Heather empted her cash drawer into the brown paper bag, and then handed it to Margaret, who did the same, including a bunch of rolled coins. There were two other tellers further down the counter, but Eustace snatched the bag from Margaret before she could hand it to the next in line. The sack had a nice heft—a couple of cats, maybe. Eustace wondered how much he was making off with. It was a simple curiosity, not greed. Ten dollars or ten thousand, it made no nevermind to him.</p><p>Moving at top speed—a considerable effort for meager result—Eustace headed for the door. No one got in his way. Some folks even dropped to the floor with their hands over their heads, which was fine with Eustace, even though it wasn’t strictly necessary. When he finally reached the exit, a man in a shirt and tie actually held the door open for him. Eustace sketched a little salute with his left hand.</p><p>Outside, the Merc, now the Getaway Car, waited for him, idling in the cripple spot. He flung open the door and lowered himself in, cackling. His bones hardly hurt at all.</p><p>He popped the Merc into reverse and stomped on the gas. The old girl’s tires squealed—actually squealed!—and he clipped the car parked next to him, knocking the rearview mirror off and drawing a long black scratch across its doors. Two people had emerged from the bank, probably to get a look at the Merc’s plates. Let them look. Maybe they’d go and arrest Useless Son.</p><p>In his excitement, Eustace lost track of the arrows directing him out of the parking lot and wound up driving a quick lap around a vacuum repair shop, before simply plowing over a low concrete planter filled with evergreen bushes and back out onto the main drag. The car bucked and swayed, throwing Eustace up against the rotting headliner and then sliding him across the seat so hard that he lost contact with the pedals and the engine stalled, leaving the Merc sprawled across two lanes of traffic while he crawled back behind the wheel and started her back up.</p><p>He had no escape route planned. He just went, plunging straight ahead, ignoring red lights and yield signs. People honked and swerved out of his way. Swinging wide around a corner, he came within a half second of t-boning a minivan. The Merc, built in the days when gas could safely be guzzled, accelerated steadily, her wheezy guts really warming up for the first time in a long, long while.</p><p>It didn’t take long for the cops to appear. They filled the rearview mirror with red and blue lights like fireworks on the fourth of July, but they couldn’t catch him. The Merc was a comet, a blur. Eventually, the road met an interstate highway and Eustace swerved across two lanes to make the onramp. The cops howled in pursuit.</p><p>He headed west, up into the mountains, four nearly empty lanes of pristine blacktop. Traffic had snarled up in the eastbound lanes though, a stream of headlights in the growing dusk, worker bees headed home after a long day making honey for a queen they had probably never met. Eustace could imagine all those tired faces turning to watch his black Merc scream past, tailed by the cop cars and their flashing lights. It was a high speed chase, by God! Something to tell the wife about over supper that night.</p><p>The mountains ahead formed a jagged blue wall against the horizon. Eustace knew the freeway went through the mountains and all the way out into Utah. That was a lot of blacktop. Sadly, he was never going to see it. The Merc couldn’t hope to outrun the police cruisers forever. Worse, exhaustion was gaining on Eustace faster than the cops were gaining on his car. This needed an ending.</p><p>Since Eustace was more or less letting the car drive herself by this point, he didn’t see any real harm in letting go of the steering wheel entirely. He grabbed the paper bag filled with his loot and ripped it open. Bills, some of them banded together, others loose, spilled onto his lap along with a silver cascade of change. How much had he owed the bank? It had seemed like a lot back then, but with out-of-control inflation that jerked a nickel bottle of Coke up to a dollar and some, maybe what he had in his lap came somewhere close to the amount they had taken his house for. Even-stevens.</p><p>“Ha!” Eustace yodeled, throwing his head back for the pure joy of revenge and motion and everything else. A concrete divider appeared before the Merc’s windshield and advanced at an alarming pace, but Eustace corrected his course almost casually and the Merc swerved away with whole inches to spare. He grabbed a fist full of those lose bills with his free hand and threw them out the window. The wind pulled them up into the sky. More moolah followed, just as fast as Eustace could chuck it. Quarters and nickels hit the blacktop and skipped up over the barrier in the middle of the interstate, where they landed on those commuter’s cars like hail, startling their driver’s attention away from the hurtling black Merc. An entire stack of bills splattered like a fragile bird against the windshield of one of the police cars behind him. It’s paper band burst and the bills flapped free, a month’s pay for the two cops inside, blowing away like still-green autumn leaves.</p><p>Eustace couldn’t stop cackling. All his life he’d been afraid, when he should have been a pirate. He tossed the last handful of available cash out the window. There was still more, but it was hiding under the floor mats or cruising around the back, riding the eddies moving through the car. One bill wrapped itself around the gearshift, flapping like a tiny flag. He watched it, fascinated.</p><p>It was then that the Merc died. It wasn’t out of gas, nothing temporary like that. A thunk rocked the car, he felt it through the seat, and then the engine just cut out. Probably a rod come loose. She was done. More than his years as a professional mechanic, being ninety-two and attending a funeral for just about everyone he had ever known made Eustace an expert at fatal sounds.</p><p>He shifted into neutral and glanced at the speedometer. At the moment of death they had been cruising along at eighty-five miles per hour. Not so shabby, but the freeway up into the mountains was steep and the Merc’s momentum bled away fast. Sixty, then fifty, then forty. Eustace pulled over to the shoulder and flipped on the emergency blinkers.</p><p>The cop cars formed up in a wide file behind the Merc, blocking off traffic. Eustace could see more flashing lights coming down from the mountains, eastbound in the westbound lanes. In just a few minutes they would have him surrounded. Good, good.</p><p>“Put your hands on the wheel,” a voice bellowed so loudly that Eustace was momentarily startled into thinking God had spoken to him.</p><p>Some of the policemen advanced on the car; crouched over with their guns pointed at the ground.</p><p>Just then, something next to Eustace exploded with a soft thump and the whole car was full of purple paint. It had gotten all over him, too. They did that. Put dye bombs in with the stolen loot. Why it had waited this long to go off, Eustace didn’t know. He started to laugh so hard that he couldn’t breathe, tears rolling down his cheeks. Until just then, he wouldn’t have guessed his body contained enough moisture for tears.</p><p>“Put your hands on the wheel,” the voice said again.</p><p>Eustace considered the gun on the seat next to him. It wasn’t loaded, but it could still serve a purpose. If he wanted it to. He could pick it up one last time. He could finish what he had started. He could go out in high style. A hail of gunfire. Another phrase that stung like clean whiskey.</p><p>So, was he done? The cops were there, waiting. Eustace looked at the Peacemaker. Put a hand on it.</p><p>The Merc’s door swung open and Eustace emerged, one limb at a time, struggling to extract himself.</p><p>“Stop,” the voice howled, “or we will shoot!”</p><p>Eustace did not stop. He pulled himself up to his full six feet (minus a few inches on account of his hump), in front of all those lights. He wouldn’t stop, not until they made him. Addled by exhaustion and the first squirts of adrenaline he’d enjoyed in many a long year, Eustace wasn’t sure they could stop him.</p><p>There was something he’d learned serving his country during the war in Europe, something those crazy Brit bastards did, their way of flipping someone off. It was the same thing Nixon did, only reversed, the back of the fingers out, instead of in. The way he understood it, the French once made a habit of cutting off their British captives’ first two fingers so they couldn’t shoot a longbow in war anymore. So, showing an enemy your two fingers in that wide V shape meant you were still dangerous, still able to put an arrow though a man’s heart.</p><p>He raised his gun hand, those two fingers up and spread, covered in purple dye. But he didn’t have the Peacemaker. It was still in the Merc. He stood there, rigidly at attention, saluting the cops with his two fingers until they put the cuffs on him.</p><p>Turned out, he wasn’t done after all.</p><p>The judge called Eustace the most audacious criminal he had ever sentenced and furthermore, the oldest bank robber on record, which tickled Eustace just to death. He clapped his hands together and cawed his old man laugh and goddamned if that judge didn’t smile a little bit as he banged the gavel down. Right there was a moment Eustace would have hated to miss.</p><p>And it wasn’t the last. They put Eustace in with a young buck, just fifty-one, serving time for counterfeiting and robbery and assault and murder and Lord knew what else. He was Mexican, with a little South American Dictator’s pencil mustache, but he spoke English pretty good. Since there was nothing else to do in the cell, Jesus (that’s HEY-soos, not GEE-zus) sometimes told stories about the crimes that got him thrown in jail. Screwing and shooting and outsmarting the hell out of people. Eustace had no idea how many of Jesus’s stories were true, how many were co-opted from someone else and how many were made up out of whole cloth, but the Mexican paced the floor of their cell like a tiger as he spun them, acting out the interesting parts, and wasn’t that better than a comatose roommate who only announced his presence by shitting himself? You betcha.</p><p>Eustace knew what happened in prison—shower room things—and a little of that went on, but no one ever bothered him, probably because he looked like a day-glow stick of beef jerky in his orange prison uniform and even worse out of it. On the few occasions someone gave him any hassle, Jesus and his Mexican buddies took care of it, because Jesus liked him.</p><p>It got boring sometimes, but boredom was an old friend of his. To kill that old friend, he could watch television or read. The food was even good—well, better than it had been at the Eldercare—and they let him smoke, a verboten activity at the home. He paid for the cigs out of money he made swabbing out the bathrooms. He enjoyed that. He liked having a purpose again, even if it was scrubbing down stainless-steel johns.</p><p>He would serve out his life here, however much of it remained, but he didn’t mind. He almost never thought about that Peacemaker and the messy deliverance it had once offered. Because there were prisons, and there were prisons.</p><p>The difference being that this was a prison of his own making.</p><p>A man could live in a place like that.</p>&#13;</div>&#13; &#13;<div class="footnoteCollection col-xs-12 col-ms-2 col-sm-offset-2 col-sm-8" data-footnote-collection="1">&#13;<ul class="footnotes"></ul>&#13;</div>&#13; &#13; &#13; &#13; &#13;<div class="socialButtons col-xs-12">&#13; <a onclick="window.open('http://twitter.com/share?text=' + encodeURIComponent('A Last Minute Truth') + ' %7C A short story by Zachary Bell %7C via @zachary_bell &amp;url=http://bit.ly/1ZEFyn3', 'windowOpenTab', 'width=600,height=450,left=100, top=100'); return false" href=""><span class="icon-twitter"></span></a>&#13; <a onclick="window.open('http://reddit.com/submit?url=http://www.zacharybell.net/content/2015/10/08/a-last-minute-truth.html&amp;title=' + encodeURIComponent('A Last Minute Truth'), 'windowOpenTab', 'width=1000,height=600,left=100, top=100'); return false" href=""><span class="icon-reddit"></span></a>&#13; <a onclick="window.open('https://www.facebook.com/dialog/feed?app_id=1175371049143599&amp;display=popup&amp;caption=An%20example%20caption&amp;link=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.facebook.com%2Fdocs%2F&amp;redirect_uri=https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer'&#13;&#10;, 'windowOpenTab', 'width=600,height=600,left=100, top=100'); return false" href=""><span class="icon-facebook"></span></a>&#13; <a onclick="window.location.href = 'mailto:?subject=' + encodeURIComponent('A Last Minute Truth') + '%3A%20A%20short%20story%20by%20Zachary%20Bell&amp;body=' + encodeURIComponent('Old, embittered and depressed, Eustace decides to kill himself.
