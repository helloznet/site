Now you have an infernal butler.<sup><a class="footLink--upper" id="footLink--upper_1" href="#footLink--lower_1" data-footnote-number="1">1</a></sup> Putting on a condom requires a more extensive diagram.</p><p>But if really is that easy, everyone’s perfectly-shined shoes would smell of brimstone.</p><p>The fact is, demons are almost impossible to summon and anyone who says otherwise is likely sitting on a surplus of hensbane.</p><p>Why?</p><p>The Devil is—quite literally—in the details.</p><p>Until recently, just learning a true name posed a serious obstacle. Demons are keen to keep their true names a secret of course, but the larger problem was simple illiteracy. In the days of the earliest summoners, most people dropped out of school the moment they dropped out of the womb. If someone wanted to learn how to read, they had to agree to celibacy<sup><a class="footLink--upper" id="footLink--upper_2" href="#footLink--lower_2" data-footnote-number="2">2</a></sup> and a tonsure for the privilege and then, the only books available tended to be either a Bible or a Bible. Everything else was locked in the priory cellar.</p><p>That was before, though. Things are quite different now, in an age where the Internet can provide page after page of true names, from the lowliest denizen to the very Lords of Hell. And the list of true names extends past Hell and into Heaven. Indeed, the true name of God well known and easy enough to pronounce: YHWH. Some dimwit will tell you that YHWH actually translates either to <em>He Creates</em> or <em>I Am</em>, but it could easily be argued that either is the only possible name for the Almighty. Also, as God is everywhere simultaneously, there is no need to summon Him to the living room like a common denizen; He's already there.<sup><a class="footLink--upper" id="footLink--upper_3" href="#footLink--lower_3" data-footnote-number="3">3</a></sup></p><p>So that’s step one—getting the name—which leaves us only step two: saying the name. And therein lies the difficultly.</p><p>Bethannal, Lord of the Fifth Pit's true name is Cik'dasra' Diq' Drisgzügatizzyrchs’ Ahrhch’ Òehp 'Caxxcuxst. This has been known for thousands of years but Bethannal has never been summoned by a mortal and probably never will be, because that string of gibberish looks more like a keyboard seizure than a sound human lips might make.</p><p>Most summonings are accidental. A man nailing some sheet metal to the roof of his hut hits his thumb with a hammer and the interplay of the his feet on the sheet metal as he hops up and down with his florid cursing in Urdu summons a couple of hellflies. Or a woman, demonstrating the a malfunctioning garbage disposal for her landlord, trips over a Pomeranian, knocks over a wine rack and suddenly there’s a greater succubus in the kitchen.</p><p>Given the difficulty of summoning a demon, what is an aspiring summoner to do?</p><p>Well, there is another way. Though it is foolish and nearly always fatal, one can get help from the infernal realm itself.</p><p>Accident and folly. That’s how a demon gets summoned.</p><p>So begins begins the story of Timothy Martin.</p><h3 id="1-On_Timothy">On Timothy<a class="icon-angle-up topLink" href="#toc"></a></h3><p>When he summoned his first demon, Timothy was a twenty-four-year-old short order cook from Akron, Ohio. Despite later embellishments—mostly circulated by Timothy himself—he was not an impressive specimen. In all things actuarial or demographical Timothy inhabited the losing tail of the American bell curve. He was of low-average height, fatish, oily about the T-zone, small of genitals, nearsighted and actually dumb enough to think he might be smart.</p><p>About a three-and-a-half out of ten gene-propagation wise.</p><p>Timothy was also a geek. Which is fine. Good even, as he happened to be born into one of those rare periods of history where the geeks temporarily inherit the mainstream and therefore the Earth. Unfortunately for Timothy, his particular patch of geekdom was not computers or math—which could have led to lucrative employment—nor was it comic books—useful at least for reminding confused girlfriends/boyfriends who the blue fellow is during a midnight showing of <em>X-Men</em>.</p><p>No, Timothy’s affliction was not useful, nor was it broadly accepted. Or terribly specific. For lack of an exact appellation Timothy was a hippie or a pagan or an elf. A historical reenactor. A tapestry fancier. A mystic seeker. A horoscope composer. A believer in fairies, a LARPer, a writer of cringe-inducing poetry written in Elvish, a wearer of tights and of fey little boots.</p><p>As is often the case with people of this broad type, Timothy also collected objects of the occult. It started with the usual gateway drugs—<em>The Hobbit</em> and maybe some RenFest on the the weekends—but then he got a taste of the harder stuff—pewter unicorns—and soon he had a full on howling-wolf teeshirt habit. What portion of his paycheck remained after food and rent generally went to crystals, candles molded into skull shapes, genuine recreation ritual daggers, wands, supposed palantír, tinctures in little glass bottles, drinking horns, authentic leather breaches and so on. Books were his real weakness though. He had several thousand, on subjects ranging from spriggan habitats to improving sexual potency though the power of the equinox. Some of these books were ancient holy texts while others involved many-sided dice before one could know if the Mind Flayer had successfully enslaved the halfling.</p><p>Frequently, Timothy would mutter spells from those books while sitting at his his desk, his finger moving slowly down the page. He didn’t really believe magic worked. But he completely believed magic worked.</p><p>And he was right.</p><p>It should be obvious by now that Timothy was both desperately unhappy and only apathetically tacked to his sanity, a trait he had in common with the greatest necromancers, infernologers, and golem smiths down through the ages. Indeed, allowing for some details, Timothy’s early life almost mirrored that of Rasputin except that he lacked the mad monk’s intelligence, charm and breathtaking facial hair. Timothy’s career would also be somewhat shorter and less spectacular.</p><h3 id="2-The_Book">The Book<a class="icon-angle-up topLink" href="#toc"></a></h3><p>The first link in the chain that would ultimately bind Timothy to his destiny was forged when he decided to stop by Fancy's Fancy one day after his shift at the Denny's Restaurant where he worked.</p><p>Fancy's was either a New Age bookstore that happened to stock an extensive selection of pornographic videos in the back room or a porn store lurking behind a selection of dried herbs and moon charts like some sort commercial antlion. The later seems more likely, as hippie nonsense alone likely does not mortgage pay.</p><p>Henry, the man who ran the bookstore-cum-porn<sup><a class="footLink--upper" id="footLink--upper_4" href="#footLink--lower_4" data-footnote-number="4">4</a></sup> shop, waved at Timothy as he entered.</p><p>“Evening,” Henry said as Timothy entered, “Look like it’s going to snow again our there again?”</p><p>“Sure,” Timothy said.</p><p>“Got a bunch of new ones for you,” Henry said, gesturing to a heap of books on the floor next to the counter. “Got them at an estate sale just this morning. Good stuff, I think.”</p><p>“Okay, cool,” Timothy said.</p><p>As he went sniffing around the pile, Timothy immediately noticed a some of the books had pentagrams on their covers. Interest piqued, he burrowed deeper into pile and then, as if fated, his hand emerged clutching a plain brown tome.</p><p>“Know anything about this one?” Timothy said.</p><p>Under casual inspection the book seemed unremarkable. It was bound in brown leather<sup><a class="footLink--upper" id="footLink--upper_5" href="#footLink--lower_5" data-footnote-number="5">5</a></sup>, but not ostentatiously. It was not thick, nor was it thin. It had no smell at all, not the exciting, bland tang of a new book, nor the musty, earthy musk of an old book. Almost anything could have resided between those covers, but even in that first moment, Henry didn’t like the look of it. He didn’t like the lines of its spine. He didn’t like the color of its cover. The whole thing was offensive somehow, distressing like an Escher painting.</p><p>“What’s the title?” Henry said, apprehensively.</p><p>“Don’t know. Doesn’t say on the cover or the spine.”</p><p>“Huh. Well, what’s it look like inside?”</p><p>Timothy flipped through the book.</p><p>“It’s not in English.”</p><p>Timothy carried the tome over and set it on Henry’s counter, open to a page somewhere in the middle. Henry nearly told Timothy to get the hell away from him with that thing, but he didn’t. Instead, he took a closer look.</p><p>“Looks Arabic,” Henry said.</p><p>“Yeah, I think it does,” Timothy said.<sup><a class="footLink--upper" id="footLink--upper_6" href="#footLink--lower_6" data-footnote-number="6">6</a></sup></p><p>Aside from a certain crawliness to the characters, the writing inside that book looked nothing at all like Arabic.</p><p>“Hey, look at these,” Henry said, turning the book to an illustration that covered a two-page spread. It was a medieval woodcut of a skeleton playing a flute while a city—with all of its screaming inhabitants—burned in the background.<sup><a class="footLink--upper" id="footLink--upper_7" href="#footLink--lower_7" data-footnote-number="7">7</a></sup></p><p>“Wow,” Timothy said, flipping through a few pages, stopping on another woodcut of a turtle with crab legs and a pair of bat wings stomping on naked human forms.<sup><a class="footLink--upper" id="footLink--upper_8" href="#footLink--lower_8" data-footnote-number="8">8</a></sup></p><p>All in all, it was exactly the sort of book Timothy couldn’t resist. But to be fair, it was a book <em>no one</em> could really resist.</p><p>“How much do you want for it?” Timothy said.</p><p>Mostly, Henry wanted to get rid of the book. That feeling of wrongness had grown. Still, he wouldn’t let a little unease stand in the way of wringing Timothy’s wallet like a dishrag.</p><p>“Fifty bucks. Might be worth more than that, but I ain't had it appraised and since you're my favorite customer...”</p><p>“Sold,” Timothy said, thinking of how he could use the book as a prop for a priest costume he was going to put together for next year’s RenFest.</p><p>Timothy handed over the money, realized he still had a few bucks to spend and picked up a pornographic DVD from the bargain bin. Henry put Timothy’s purchases in a bag and handed it over with a smile.</p><p>Now is probably a good time to step out of the narrative for a moment and discuss the book in that bag, lying innocently enough next to the pornographic DVD. The book had no title. More specifically, it had no name. It wasn’t even a book, really. What Timothy had purchased was a knotted inversion, an irreducible particle. A describer of reality. As such, it was impossible for the thing to have a name, the same way its impossible to spell the letter ‘G’.<sup><a class="footLink--upper" id="footLink--upper_9" href="#footLink--lower_9" data-footnote-number="9">9</a></sup></p><p>Nameless or not, the book was one of the most dangerous objects to be found anywhere on Earth, for it contained on its pages the true names of a thousand denizens, creatures of the Pit both big and small. That alone didn’t mean much, as we’ve already discussed, but in addition to containing true names, the book itself possessed a sort of awareness and if it chose, it could whisper the correct pronunciations into the summoner’s ear.</p><p>That object, that so-called book, held the words that would be spoken on the eve of Armageddon to bring forth the Horsemen.</p><p>Timothy Martin was not the ideal steward for such an object.</p><h3 id="3-A_Demon_Appears">A Demon Appears<a class="icon-angle-up topLink" href="#toc"></a></h3><p>Back home, Timothy climbed up to his third floor apartment and let himself in. His roommates, a pair of useless, never-employed hairbags, were sitting on the couch, playing video games.</p><p>“Hey dude,” one of them said. His name was Sling, or so he called himself, mostly out of embarrassment that he wasn’t smart enough to bear the proud, nebbish name Herbert Richard Tower-Singleton.</p><p>“Yeah, hey,” the other said. This was Chris, who, unlike his roommates, usually had a girlfriend or two. Most of his success in this regard could be attributed to two things: he had long, stringy rockstar hair and he could play <em>Rivers of Babylon</em> on the guitar well enough to maintain the illusion his hair projected.</p><p>“Guys, damnit,” Timothy said, by way of greeting. “I told you to put those pizza boxes in the trash.”</p><p>The apartment looked like a consignment shop carpeted sporadically in pizza boxes. What few decorations they possessed tended towards posters of girls in short-shorts twined around gigantic beer bottles.<sup><a class="footLink--upper" id="footLink--upper_10" href="#footLink--lower_10" data-footnote-number="10">10</a></sup> Under the pizza boxes lurked a carpet so thoroughly stained in bong water and worse that the boxes were actually an improvement.</p><p>“We’ll get to it, man,” Sling said. Except to take a single piss, Sling had not left the couch for going on six hours.</p><p>“Whatever,” Timothy muttered and made his way towards his room at the very back of the apartment. He set the bag, containing the book and the pornographic DVD on his desk and began to undress for a shower.</p><p>Exactly two minutes and forty-nine seconds later, Timothy sprinted through the living room stark naked and screaming like a veal-calf on the last day of its incarceration. Riding on top of his head was a small, pitch-black bucket imp clutching it’s bucket with one hand and Timothy’s hair with the other.</p><p>Again we must step back. What is a bucket imp? How did one come to be jockeying Timothy like a grandstanding rodeo cowboy?</p><p>Hell is a complicated place that requires a great deal of upkeep, but The Lords of the Pit are old-fashioned beings with little interest in automation. Rather than relying on trucks and conveyor belts and steam shovels to get things done, Hell is run like a Medieval serfdom and there is a great deal of manual labor involved. One of the bigger jobs is moving liquids and semi-liquids from one place to another; Hell has lakes, actual lakes, of bile, shit, brimstone, magma, sulfur, tears, digestive juices and boreworm semen that need to be moved from one place to another, for one purpose or another, and all that moving falls to brigades of bucket imps.</p><p>The imps are only six inches tall on average and humanoid in shape, though they possess a tail and a pair of oversized horns, relative to their tiny bodies. These distinguishing marks aside, the thing that most defines a bucket imp is their tendency to lose track of one or more of their axis. That is, they can have height, width and depth, but rarely all three at the same time. Also, they’re not much bothered by gravity and float wherever they please. Physics is unhappy about bucket imps.</p><p>Technically, bucket imps aren’t really even demons; they’re stitched together from the remnants of damned souls, though those souls are so processed and modified that bucket imps are made of sinners the way a wiffleball is made of apatosauruses. To the layman a bucket imp looks, acts and smells like a real demon, only on a small scale.</p><p>They are, like everything else in Hell, more than a little ornery. It takes a full squad of whip damei to motivate one brigade of bucket imps and a full dozen gate lords (who aren’t really lords, but merely middle-management) to oversee one squad of bucket imps, all to perform a job that humans can accomplish with a sump pump.</p><p>It isn’t angels or the forces of good keeping Hell at bay, but rather Hell’s own bureaucracy.</p><p>Obviously, poor Timothy had no intention of summoning a demon. He had merely taken off his clothes for a shower, stopped by the book on his way into the bathroom and flipped to a page that had a picture of a woman with horns having sex with a knight.<sup><a class="footLink--upper" id="footLink--upper_11" href="#footLink--lower_11" data-footnote-number="11">11</a></sup></p><p>Smiling, Timothy touched the horned woman’s little woodcut breasts and then let his finger slide over onto the text next to her.</p><p>“********” Timothy said softly, surprised by how good it felt to say those strange syllables, how perfectly they formed up in his mind, how dexterous his tongue felt.</p><p>It should be noted, in the interest of science, that Timothy was was idly yanking on his flaccid pud as he spoke the syllables, a fact which may or may not have had some impact on what happened next.</p><p>Before the last sigh of air had passed Timothy’s lips, the bucket imp appeared in front of him. While major denizens will mark their arrival on the mortal plane with smoke, sulfuric odors, lightning crashes, torrents of blood, vistas of the fields of Hell, etc, peons like the bucket imps simply appear. Sometimes there is a small ‘pop’ noise.</p><p>The two looked at each other for a moment. Then the imp lunged.</p><p>And now you’re all caught up.</p><h3 id="4-Cook_Vs_Janitor">Cook Vs. Janitor<a class="icon-angle-up topLink" href="#toc"></a></h3><p>Timothy’s terrified sprint through the apartment ended abruptly when a pizza box slipped out from under his heel, sending him careening into the kitchenette, where he landed flat on his back.<sup><a class="footLink--upper" id="footLink--upper_12" href="#footLink--lower_12" data-footnote-number="12">12</a></sup></p><p>The bucket imp detached itself well before Timothy’s crash and remained in the air above him, bobbing gently like a balloon on a string.</p><p>Sling and Chris stared at bucket imp floating above Timothy with the all the intensity of two drowsy hedgehogs.</p><p>“The fuck?” Chris muttered.</p><p>“Get the book!” Timothy hollered. His extensive education in the supposed dark arts had taught him nothing of any use whatsoever in this particular situation, save one universal truth of demonology: far more important than the ritual to bring forth a demon is the ritual to put it away again.</p><p>“What is that?” Sling said.</p><p>“Get the boooooooook,” Timothy wailed. He was trying to stand up, but every time he made a move, the bucket imp snarled and lunged in horns-first, which caused Timothy to fall back and flail his limbs like an infant on a changing table. His antics made the imp giggle, which was a horrible, nerves-combed-with-needles sort of sound.</p><p>Chris peeled himself off the couch and took a few steps towards the imp, holding out a hand like he was approaching a strange dog. The imp hurled its little bucket, hitting the curious hairbag directly on the snout.</p><p>“Owww, shit,” Chris said.</p><p>The imp zoomed down to catch the bucket on the rebound and then launched a second attack, this time striking him on the forehead. Again, the imp neatly retrieved its projectile.</p><p>“Get the book!” Timothy screamed.</p><p>“What book, dude?” Sling said. Now he was off the couch and making short lunges in various directions, only lacking something to lunge at or away from.</p><p>Chris, mustering a heretofore unknown reserve of courage, grabbed the first object he could lay hands on and took a swing at the bucket imp. That object turned out to be a wok lid sitting on the counter and it hit the imp with a musical bong. The creature bounced against the wall with more force than its two-dimensional form would suggest.</p><p>It’s a common misconception that bucket imps don’t feel pain.<sup><a class="footLink--upper" id="footLink--upper_13" href="#footLink--lower_13" data-footnote-number="13">13</a></sup> They do. Down in the Infernal Realms, pain is so ubiquitous that the imp had been shocked momentarily senseless by pain’s <em>absence</em> upon its arrival in the hairbag plane. Imagine jumping into an icy mountain stream, only in reverse. So really, a wok lid to the face went a long way towards making the imp feel more at home.</p><p>With a snarl, the imp lunged at Sling, clanging bucket against wok lid, filling the apartment with an unholy din. The other two housemates took up battle as well, Sling armed with a cushion from the couch and Timothy slap-fighting fearsomely, which looked something like a starveling chicken trying to escape a washing machine.</p><p>“Trap it in the bathroom,” Timothy said.</p><p>Through bulk and adrenal-induced berserkerism, the boys managed to push the imp down the hallway. It bobbed and darted in front of them, never touching the ground, lashing its tail like an angry cat.</p><p>Timothy managed to throw open the bathroom door. With a roar, Sling batted it past the entryway with the wok lid. Chris threw the pillow and in the instant the little creature dodged back out of the way, Timothy slammed the door, sealing it inside.</p><p>“Hey, Tim?” Sling said.</p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>"What's in our bathroom?"</p><p>“I’m not sure, I’m not sure,” Timothy whined, leaning against the wall.</p><p>“Oh,” Sling said, considering this.</p><p>The boys spent a moment trying to regain their breath. The battle of the hallway had been more exercise than they’d had in maybe a year.</p><p>“Hey, Tim?” Sling said.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Why are you naked?”</p><p>Timothy gazed down upon his nudity. Than a bang from the other side of the door startled him out of his cock-reverie.</p><p>“We gotta get that book," he said.</p><p>“What book are you talking about?” Sling said.</p><p>“You gotta get some pants,” Chris said.</p><p>“Fuck pants. We need the book.”</p><p>“Pants,” Chris insisted.</p><p>“Seriously,” Sling agreed.</p><p>The bucket banged against the door.</p><p>“I’ll be right back,” Timothy said.</p><p>The neophyte summoner shambled off at a half run, his pale, flabby-yet-scrawny buttocks jiggling.<sup><a class="footLink--upper" id="footLink--upper_14" href="#footLink--lower_14" data-footnote-number="14">14</a></sup> When he returned, he was hopping into the pants he had worn at work all day while trying to flip through the book at the same time. This operation failed when he slipped on another pizza box, leaving him sprawled on the floor, somehow hogtied by his black work slacks.</p><p>“I told you to pick up those boxes,” Timothy nearly sobbed, regaining his footing and, at long, long last, managing to shove his genitals back into his pants.</p><p>“Fuck the boxes. What is that thing?” Chris demanded.</p><p>“It’s a demon. I summoned it.”</p><p>“You summoned it? Fuck you, man.”</p><p>“It’s one of these.”</p><p>He showed the roommates a picture of a bucket imp.</p><p>“Maybe it’s a bat,” Chris said.</p><p>“We need to send it back,” Timothy said. He started leafing through pages.</p><p>Still locked in the bathroom, the imp threw its bucket against the door in a quick, triple beat. <em>Toktoktok</em>.<sup><a class="footLink--upper" id="footLink--upper_15" href="#footLink--lower_15" data-footnote-number="15">15</a></sup></p><p>“There’s a demon in the bathroom?” Sling said, celebrating Christmas on Boxing Day.</p><p>“Here,” Timothy said pointing to a passage. “I think this is it.”</p><p>“You think what?” Sling said.</p><p>“This is how you unsummon it. I think.”</p><p>"Unsummon it? Dude, there is no way that thing is—" Chris said, but he was cut off when Timothy’s convincing rebuttal hurled its bucket against the door again.</p><p>“Let me see that,” Chris said instead, snatching the book. “These are letters, but the words aren’t even sounds.”</p><p>“It’s the demon’s name, I think. We just have to say that and then…tell it to go home.</p><p>“That’s it, huh,” Chris said, then muttered “asshole.”</p><p>“A demon. Thats kinda cool,” Sling said.</p><p>“You have to trust me,” Timothy said.</p><p>“No, I don’t,” Chris said.</p><p>“I summoned it. I can unsummon it,” Timothy said with some conviction.<sup><a class="footLink--upper" id="footLink--upper_16" href="#footLink--lower_16" data-footnote-number="16">16</a></sup></p><p><em>Toktoktok</em>, the imp interjected with it’s bucket.</p><p>“I need you to open the door and push it back long enough for me to say the words.”</p><p>“Demon. Okay. Fuck it,” Chris said. He took a deep breath and then, with a shout, he pushed the door open.</p><h3 id="5-The_Situation_Gets_Worse">The Situation Gets Worse<a class="icon-angle-up topLink" href="#toc"></a></h3><p>The imp was hovering over at the toilet, busily bailing the water out of the bowl and onto the floor. It was nervous and bailing soothes a nervous imp. Lost in its familiar task, the little shadow just looked at the boys and blinked its yellow eyes.</p><p><em>Splash</em>, said the bucket, tipping about about a quarter of a cup of water onto the floor.</p><p>“********,” Timothy intoned, book open in one hand, other arm raised theatrically.</p><p>Another bucket imp promptly appeared just behind his left ear.<sup><a class="footLink--upper" id="footLink--upper_17" href="#footLink--lower_17" data-footnote-number="17">17</a></sup></p><p>Timothy shrieked and batted at the newcomer with the book. The imp hissed and flitted away but Timothy, with help from Chris, managed to push this new visitor into the bathroom. Unfortunately, somewhere in the melee, Tim actually threw the book at the imp and then Chris slammed the door.</p><p>“See? I told you I can summon them,” Timothy said.</p><p>“Great job, man. Really great job,” Chris said, back against the door. On the other side, the imps hammered for a while and then things went quiet.</p><p>“What are they doing in there?” Sling said, pressing his ear to the door. “I can hear them. Are they talking?”<sup><a class="footLink--upper" id="footLink--upper_18" href="#footLink--lower_18" data-footnote-number="18">18</a></sup></p><p>“We need to call the cops,” Sling said, “for real.”</p><p>“Yeah,” Timothy said, “The police are highly trained to handle demons. Like they’d even believe us. No. Were on our own.<sup><a class="footLink--upper" id="footLink--upper_19" href="#footLink--lower_19" data-footnote-number="19">19</a></sup></p><p>“Trained? Like you are?” Chris said, “Sling, go call the cops."</p><p>Sling's phone was lost somewhere out in the wilds of the couch cushions, but he eventually returned, already on the line with the police.</p><p>“Yeah. Something in the bathroom. I don't know what. Uh huh. Maybe uhh…”</p><p>Sling looked at Chris for help.</p><p>“A dog,” Chris mouthed.</p><p>“Yeah, maybe its a dog. Maybe,” Chris said, “A really big dog. Yeah, it’s a big dog.”</p><p>A long pause.</p><p>“No, it is an emergency. Animal control is...no. Hey. I didn't actually see it, okay? It's really...I don't know, dude. Maybe its like an escaped tiger?”</p><p>“Sling, shut up,” Chris said.</p><p>“We’re in the Barton Apartment building. Apartment thirty six.”</p><p>A pause.</p><p>“I don’t know. Maybe it came up in the elevator,” Sling said. “No, don’t, look…I”</p><p>Sling started screaming into the phone.</p><p>“Aaaaahh, shit, it’s got out. Oh shit, oh shiiiiittt. Aaaahh! Help!”</p><p>He ended the call.</p><p>“Well?” Timothy said.</p><p>“They didn’t want to come,” Sling said, “But they probably will. Thats kinda fucked up. Us calling the cops.”</p><p>“I can definitely hear those things talking in there,” Chris said, pressing an ear to the door.</p><p>“I’m gonna go get a shirt, Timothy said. Now that they had guests coming, he was rightfully ashamed of—this colloquialism is crude, but exceedingly apt—ashamed of his bitch-tits.</p><p>The police, frequent visitors at the Barton Apartments, though usually for noise violations instead of summonings gone astray, appeared only a few minutes later. Chris greeted them at the door while the others remained stationed outside the bathroom.</p><p>“So you’ve got some kind of animal problem?” the first officer—a white guy—said.</p><p>“Yeah. They’re in the bathroom,” Chris said.</p><p>“Any of you been doing a little smoke?” the second cop—a black guy—said, eying the bong prominently displayed on the coffee table.</p><p>“No?” Sling said, really sticking the landing.</p><p>“Dog-tiger in the bathroom, huh? Been seeing any other nasty critters around? Ducklings on the ceiling? Bugs under your skin, maybe?” the black cop said.</p><p>“Christ, Rick,” the white officer said, “Why not ask them if they’re hopped up on goofballs?”</p><p>“Arrest us later,” Chris said, “Just come see whats in the bathroom first.”</p><p>“Oh yeah. Thats some kind of line,” the black officer said.</p><p>The police made their way down the hall and took up position outside the bathroom, shooing the housemates out of the way.</p><p>“I don’t hear a dog,” the white officer said.</p><p>“I hear something,” the black officer said.</p><p>“What else you three want to tell us before I open this door?” the white officer said.</p><p>“Its not a dog,” Timothy said, “it’s a pair of demons I summoned.”</p><p>Its difficult to know if Timothy told the officers the truth because out of civic responsibility or an urge to boast.</p><p>“Oh. Is that all?” the white officer said and opened the door.</p><p>Two thousand, three hundred, thirty two bucket imps burst out of the bathroom in a rush of shadow and glowing yellow eyes.</p><p>Words like malevolent cloud or wicked horde might describe the scene, but tempting as that kind of dramatic language is, the imps probably don’t merit such grandiosity. Lets just call it a flock. Like seagulls. Similar to seagulls making a mass-takeoff down the beach, it was impossible to pick any one individual imp from the collective. Shrieking and giggling like schoolgirls at a slumber party, the imps rolled out into the hall, swinging their buckets.</p><p>It’s a little-known fact that demons can summon other demons and do so frequently. The whole power structure of Hell depends on it. Satan summons his Lords, his Lords summon lieutenants, the lieutenants summon their overseers, the overseers summon their assorted worker-imps and, bobsyeruncle, the Center for Infernal Justice gets a new Flaming Sodomy Annex. Bucket imps, residing as they do at the very base of Hells phone tree, have very limited authority, but they are capable of summoning one specific denizen: each other.</p><p>Under ordinary circumstances though, imps cannot summon anything at all on the mortal plane. Under ordinary circumstances, imps should never be on the mortal plane. These were not ordinary circumstances though. With the book in play, the imps were capable of summoning almost anything.</p><h3 id="6-Carnage_Flight">Carnage, Flight<a class="icon-angle-up topLink" href="#toc"></a></h3><p>Imps tangled in hair. They stole the white cop’s hat. More crawled under shirts while the general majority amused themselves with non-specific bucket-whackings. The humans careened off each other and the walls, trying to escape in five different directions. Somewhere in the melee, Timothy found himself face-down on the bathroom floor. There, he saw more than a dozen imps still bailing water out of the toilet.</p><p>One of the cops—it was impossible to say which, buried as they were in imps—started firing his gun, which did a fantastic job of killing the roommates damage deposit but not much else.</p><p>Swatting frantically, the roommates managed to fall back into the living room. More gunfire emerged from the hallway. The police retreated to Timothy’s bedroom and there they died. The roommates didn’t see exactly what happened, but the gunfire turned to shouts and then screams and then the screams cut off abruptly, as if a signal had been given. The imps returned to the hallway in a lazy, cheerful cloud. Many carried buckets of blood, full to dripping.</p><p>“Oh fuck. Oooohhh fuck,” Chris said.<sup><a class="footLink--upper" id="footLink--upper_20" href="#footLink--lower_20" data-footnote-number="20">20</a></sup></p><p>Out of the apartment. Into the hallway. The roommates tried to close the door, but imps piled in the gap and, working together, they heaved it back open. Free of the apartment, they milled around in momentary confusion. The windowless hallway offered little of interest<sup><a class="footLink--upper" id="footLink--upper_21" href="#footLink--lower_21" data-footnote-number="21">21</a></sup> so the imps resumed their chase, squeaking their ridiculous little battle cries as the boys fled before them.</p><p>Waiting on the elevator didn’t seem wise, given the horde of imps, so Chris led them down the stairs, pursued at every step until they burst out the door.</p><p>It was full dark outside now. It was also snowing, big, department store flakes<sup><a class="footLink--upper" id="footLink--upper_22" href="#footLink--lower_22" data-footnote-number="22">22</a></sup> that fell in delightfully lazy flips and glides under the streetlights, but the roommates, fleeing from a growing legion of Hell, didn’t take time to appreciate the tranquility of the scene. Instead, they ran across the parking lot—past Timothy’s Metro<sup><a class="footLink--upper" id="footLink--upper_23" href="#footLink--lower_23" data-footnote-number="23">23</a></sup>and into the edge of a small city park that abutted the apartment complex.</p><p>The imps, aside from a few listless swings here and there, showed little interest in the humans now that they found themselves loosed upon world were frozen, bailable water fell from the sky.</p><p>The doors leading back into the apartment had never really closed under the flow of imps, but now it bulged open as a particularly large knot of the little shadows pushed free. This group had something, a brownish something, held aloft between many tiny claws and across a dozen wee backs. It was the book. With it, one of the imps was busy summoning his friends in bulk and the imps not engaged with the summoning were ranging further and further afield.</p><p>“We gotta do something,” Sling said, shifting his weight from foot to foot like he had to urinate.</p><p>“Yeah, we do,” Timothy said, with unusual steel in his voice. “And I know what.”</p><p>“Run?” Chris said.</p><p>Timothy shook his head. He was not wearing shoes or a jacket, but he was wearing his work pants<sup><a class="footLink--upper" id="footLink--upper_24" href="#footLink--lower_24" data-footnote-number="24">24</a></sup> and so he had the keys to his car in the front right pocket and his cell phone in the other. He pulled the keys out and tossed them thoughtfully from hand to hand.</p><p>“Right,” he said. His voice still carried that note of heroic resolve.</p><p>“What?” Sling ventured.</p><p>"They like water, don't they?"</p><p>"Sure?" Chris said.</p><p>“Call the police again. Tell them to bring the National Guard,” Timothy said. He handed his cell phone to Sling.</p><p>“What are you doing?” Sling said.</p><p>“I’m going to stall them.”</p><p>This wasn’t exactly a declaration of war, but it was still pretty good, considering.</p><p>“And oh,” Timothy said, turning back around, “Get a video of this.”</p><p>“Yeah. Okay,” Sling said, turning on the camera function and pointing the phone at Timothy.</p><h3 id="7-The_Heroic_Plan">The Heroic Plan<a class="icon-angle-up topLink" href="#toc"></a></h3><p>The imps ignored Timothy as he crossed the parking lot. He climbed into the Metro and turned the key. Unfortunately, the Metro had an addled, prima donna of a starter that would only deign to turn the engine over when temperatures were above forty. Now, it made a terrible screech, but that was all. He tried again and got the same screech. Timothy considered the situation. He fastened his seatbelt. He nearly cried. He pounded on the steering wheel and screamed. The other two eventually strolled over, Sling still recording. Chris tapped on the window.</p><p>Timothy took a breath.</p><p>He rolled the window down a crack.</p><p>“I need a push,” he said.</p><p>“To where?” Sling said.</p><p>“To get the car started. Get it rolling and I’ll pop start it.”</p><p>The Metro weighed about as much as a couch, so Sling and Chris were able to shove it out of the space and then reverse that motion, getting the car headed off generally in the direction of the street and the greater concentration of imps. Timothy waited until the Metro had reached a jogging speed and then he popped the clutch. The car jerked, lagged, nearly died and then puttered awake. Without pause to consider his own considerable cowardice, Timothy and put the pedal to the novelty anime-themed floor mat and the Metro hustled across the lot, across the street, up onto the opposite sidewalk and directly into a fire hydrant, which promptly exploded into a fountain of irresistible, free-running water.</p><p>Timothy, stunned and bleeding from a gash on his forehead, got out of the car and stumbled across the street before the imps landed en masse.</p><p>“That was sweet, man,” Sling yelled.</p><p>The imps, formerly wandering off to every point of the compass, about-faced and charged back to the water gushing from the broken hydrant and began bailing with pure glee.</p><p>As a delaying tactic, it appeared sound, at least for a moment. Unfortunately, there was much Timothy didn’t understand about imp psychology and their instinct to swarm. Prior to the appearance of water, the imp with the book was summoning up his pals as a way to pass the time. Now that something worth bailing had appeared, the imp considered itself back on the clock.</p><p>Empowered by the book, it chanted and imps poured forth into the moral realm. Three thousand, a full legion. Two legions. Like Alabama ants in a drought, they swarmed the hydrant, nearly blacking it out with their tiny, squirming bodies. Within a minute, perhaps less, some of the imps had chased the water back into the pipes that delivered it while others ran down every free drop in the gutters while further hordes bailed what had already been bailed. They bailed and bailed, with no direction, but unlimited energy.</p><p>“Oh, wow,” Sling said.</p><p>Sirens wailed in the far-off distance, but by the time the police arrived, the street would be filled with imps from gutters to stratosphere. This time, Timothy really might be the world’s last hope.</p><h3 id="8-The_Hero_Does_Battle">The Hero Does Battle<a class="icon-angle-up topLink" href="#toc"></a></h3><p>Timothy, owner of an AD&amp;D Monster Manual signed by Gygax, wearer of Axe brand spray-on deodorant, knight of Halo, occasional defender of his own dignity and reluctant champion of not one single thing, surveyed the scene. All up and down the street, people appeared in their doorways and peered out of windows. His car had nearly vanished under the imp heap—just its round ass stuck out of the pile—and the horde continued to multiply.</p><p>With a steadying breath, Timothy stepped off the curb. He took another step. He stripped off his teeshirt and wound it into a rope between his fists. He turned to Chris.</p><p>“Lighter,” he growled.</p><p>Chris reached into his pocket and produced a Harley-Davidson branded Zippo.<sup><a class="footLink--upper" id="footLink--upper_25" href="#footLink--lower_25" data-footnote-number="25">25</a></sup> Timothy caught the lighter without ever taking his gaze off the pile of imps and thus armed, he walked across the street.</p><p>The legions ignored him entirely. He walked right up to the car and even brushed a few of the imps away from the gas-input hole cover.<sup><a class="footLink--upper" id="footLink--upper_26" href="#footLink--lower_26" data-footnote-number="26">26</a></sup> Still unmolested, he unscrewed the cap, stuck a good length of his twisted-up shirt into the hole and then, under a continuing barrage of indifference from the imps, he painstakingly set the shirt on fire. It took a while, but eventually the flame caught and began to grow.</p><p>Timothy sprinted back to the park and his waiting friends, expecting at any moment to feel an insistent push at his back followed by a wave of heat. Instead, he arrived at the curb out of breath and the three of them turned to watch the Metro’s continued non-explosion.</p><p>“Huh,” Chris said, while Sling recorded.</p><p>The shirt flared yellow for a moment and then seemed to go out. A fresh wave of imps arrived, shifting the geometry of the pile, and the car vanished entirely under the mass of limbs and buckets. The boys watched for a while.</p><p>“Goddamnit,” Timothy panted.</p><p>“Were you trying to blow up your car?” Chris said.</p><p>The Metro exploded.</p><p>Any self-respecting revolutionary will tell you that the wick on improvised explosives—Molotov cocktails, Geo Metros—ought to be soaked in something combustible before use. Tee shirts just don’t burn all that well on their own. That Timothy’s idiotic plan worked at all was largely due to an equal idiocy working in the opposite direction. The only person dumber than Odysseus was the Trojan who thought that horse would make a good conversation piece. The idiocy was provided by one of the imps, who, frustrated by its inability to reach the water under its many, many friends, detected some sort of liquid down at the end of a tight, narrow pipe. So the imp wriggled into the hole, down past some sort of smoldering material that it found reassuringly Hell-like, then splashed into something that smelled rather cheerfully nostalgic. Pleased, the imp began bailing, as is the wont of its kind. As it bailed, a few, fine droplets of gasoline went up the pipe, where they met the last, fading ember of Timothy’s charred tee shirt.</p><p>While the little car was busy doing exciting exothermic things with gasoline, several thousand flaming imps went on unexpected journeys into the sky and the resulting fireball blinded the roommates. All up and down the block, lookieloos started screaming while Sling went right on recording.<sup><a class="footLink--upper" id="footLink--upper_27" href="#footLink--lower_27" data-footnote-number="27">27</a></sup></p><p>As for the imps, the explosion was interesting, but completely harmless as it takes a lot more than the contents of one Geo Metro’s stomach to hurt a denizen. In Hell it is considered a little rude to explode someone without cause though, so the flock drew itself back together and then whirled up into an agitated cluster, before spilling across the street like the tide. The boys—and everyone else in the vicinity—would have died then, if another demon not suddenly appeared.</p><h3 id="9-Demon_Ex_Machina">Demon Ex Machina<a class="icon-angle-up topLink" href="#toc"></a></h3><p>She was called Tiramok, and she was a lieutenant of Hell. She stood taller as the walls of Babylon, her horns were broad as a river in flood and her claws could impale four men standing front to back. A whispered word from her lips could poison, corrupt and kill. Since the Fall, she had served her master at the center of every battle and whole companies of angels scattered at the sight of her on the horizon. She was aftermath. She was the carrion crow. She was the battle lost. Her name, her true name, was the sound of rain on the ashes of a village swept bare by raiders.</p><p>Or, in this case, in the presence of the Book, her name was perfectly pronounced by hydrant water sizzling against the hot roof of a recently-exploded Geo Metro.<sup><a class="footLink--upper" id="footLink--upper_28" href="#footLink--lower_28" data-footnote-number="28">28</a></sup></p><p>Tirarmok surveyed the scene with her ghastly, ghostlamp eyes and a seismic growl issued up from her throat.</p><p>“<em>Whodares</em>?” she said in rather posh demonic.<sup><a class="footLink--upper" id="footLink--upper_29" href="#footLink--lower_29" data-footnote-number="29">29</a></sup></p><p>Then she saw the imps. And the book. And the humans standing around with expressions on their faces that revealed a complete lack of understanding.</p><p>“<em>Oh, damnit</em>,” the demon muttered, with significantly less menace.</p><p>The bucket imps threw themselves prostrate at her cloven feet.</p><p>Tirarmok sighed. Two bursts of flame erupted from her nose.</p><p>**********, she shouted.</p><p>Another demon appeared at her side. This second demon was quite menacing, but only about the size of a human, with the head of a pig, the torso of an ant and the legs of a ballerina. It carried a long whip coiled over its shoulder.</p><p>“<em>Yes, master?</em>” the new demon hissed, also in demonic.</p><p>Tirarmok pointed at the worshipful pile of imps.</p><p>“<em>Ha!</em>,” the new demon said, “<em>How’d they get up here?</em>”</p><p>Tirarmok bent and picked up the book from where it lay near the Metro. She showed it to the other demon. It was unmarked from its adventures.</p><p>“<em>Oh. That thing. Slippery, slippery,</em>.”</p><p>“He is going to be so angry,” Tirarmok muttered.</p><p>“It’s not your fault, is it? You’re not the thing’s keeper,” the other demon said.</p><p>“It’s so political. I don’t want anything to do with it.”</p><p>“Well, too late for that.”</p><p>“I suppose.”</p><p>“Best get moving.”</p><p>The pig-ant-ballerina turned to the imps.</p><p>“Right, you lot. Hup to.”</p><p>With the crack of an infernal whip, the imps pulled themselves into a raged semblance of a parade rest. A moment later, they all vanished. Tirarmok stood with the book tweezered carefully between her claws and looked up and down the street. Cops were arriving on the scene with their lights flashing.</p><p>“Idiots,” Tirarmok muttered before she too vanished.</p><p>The Metro continued to burn. Official types began their own sort of swarming, setting up barricades and cordoning off the street. Almost unnoticed, the roommates stood in the park lot.</p><p>“What just happened?” Sling said.</p><p>“I have no idea,” Chris said.</p><p>Timothy only smiled. He was a summoner now.

Heaven is a different story: no one is ever naked and under their robes angels are neuter lumps not unlike Ken and Barbie dolls. They play a lot of bingo in heaven. A lot. Hell sucks by design.

So there, now you know, while still safely within act two, of the plot device necessary to the conclusion of act three.
