It’s been an unwilling education."</h2></div><div class="row storyWrapper"><div class="story col-xs-12 col-ms-offset-1 col-ms-10 col-sm-offset-2 col-sm-8" data-story-number="1">&#13;<p>George walked into the diner and the bell above the door jingled. Albert was already on his stool, bent over a sheet of paper, laborously writing with a stub of a pencil, his coffee shoved off to the side.</p><p>“Best finish that homework, Albert,” George said, seating himself two stools down, “Bus’ll be here soon.”</p><p>“Shut up,” Albert said.</p><p>“What’s he doing?” George said to Patrice as she came by with his coffee. It was early and George and Albert were the diner’s only customers.</p><p>“He’s writing to the school board. You want the usual?” Patrice said.</p><p>“Oh. Yeah, usual’s fine,” George said.</p><p>“Coming right up.”</p><p>Patrice slapped the bell and Javier, somewhere out of sight in the kitchen, grunted a sleepy reply.</p><p>“Pat?” George said after a moment's consideration, “Why’s Albert writing the school board?”</p><p>“He’s trying to get the theory of plate tectonics removed from high school textbooks.”</p><p>“Now comes the part where I ask why he’d do such a fool thing, but I ain’t gonna, because I don’t care.”</p><p>“Board of education is working on textbook guidelines again,” Patrice said.</p><p>“Huh,” George said. He sipped loudly from his coffee.</p><p>"Ask, goddamnit," Albert said, staring at George in that way he had of staring.</p><p>“What’ve you got against plate tectonics, Albert?” George finally said.</p><p>“Nothing. I’m continental drift’s biggest fan,” Albert said, returning to his letter. He wrote with the single-minded squint of a second grader.</p><p>“So…”</p><p>“So, a theory hasn’t really hit its stride until some chromosome-poor jaw-tumor tries to get it removed from the curriculum.”</p><p>“Which is what you’re doing now.”</p><p>“Alfred Wegener was a badass, dog eating, arctic son of a bitch. I want half the people drawing X's on his grave and the other half forming a mob to dig up his corpse and put it on trial posthumously.”</p><p>Rather than ask Alfred for clarification on any of this—never a good idea—George looked over at Patrice.</p><p>“Alfred Wegner is the fella that first came up with the idea of continental drift,” Patrice offered, “ain’t that just what we need? Another Alfred, I mean.”</p><p>“Yes. The more Alfreds the better,” Alfred said.</p><p>“Did you just know that Wegner guy’s name, Pat? Am I the only ignoramus here?” George said.</p><p>“No no," Patrice said, "I’ve been listening to our Albert go on for almost an hour now. It’s been an unwilling education.”</p><p>“Yep. Alfred Wegner's name should be there with Charles Darwin, but he's never been villified propperly. I wanted Fred Phelps and his Westborough people to do it for me, but I don’t think they understand enough about plate tectonics to get a good religious panic going.”</p><p>“That and I don't recall that the Bible has a lot to say about continental drift,” George said.</p><p>“Plate tectonics is at least partially responsible for most speciation. We have kangaroos in Australia and llamas in Peru because the continents drifted apart. So there's an evolution angle. It doesn't allow for any young-earth bullshit either, because the plates move slower than glaciers. We're talking, like, a hundred thousand years is an afternoon's nap for a continent. That should be more than enough to contradict some Biblical bibble-babble."</p><p>“Instead of getting diatribe all over my eggs, trying keeping your next monologue <em>internal</em>,” George suggested.</p><p>“The Helio-centric model got its due. They threw Galileo into a tower and the Indigo Girls wrote a song about him,” Alfred said.</p><p>“The who did what?” George said.</p><p>“You ever actually listened to that song, Albert?” Patrice said.</p><p>“Hell no. I prefer real music to acoustic lesbians."</p><p>“Then why did you—? Nevermind,” Patrice said. Albert was--at best--an experience, but rarely a pleasure. She pulled a rag from a bucket and set to wiping down the counter between the kitchen and the dining area, turning her back on the men.</p><p>Albert waved off her snub with an imperious, graphite-smudged hand and went back to sermonizing, “And everyone knows who Darwin was. They still argue evolution vs. bedtime stories. Reactionary idiots dumped ice water on Ed Wilson's head for sociobiology. That's not a Snopes Monkey Trial, but at least it's <em>something</em>.”</p><p>“So, out of a sense of...fairness, you want this this other Albert, the Wegener fella, you want his name removed from textbooks?”</p><p>“No. I want someone to try to remove his name from the textbooks. Until your ideas have made a racing fan, be they NASCAR or chariot, wonder if they really will see grandma in fairyland after they die, then you haven’t arrived. Vilification is vindication. A parable.”</p><p>Alfred accompanied this speech with waggles of his pencil, as if directing the motley orchestra of his mind.</p><p>“You believe that, huh?” George said. Patrice slid his eggs across the counter with an eye-roll.</p><p>“The theory of plate tectonics is one of the most elegant, important ideas man has ever had," Alfred said.</p><p>“I ain’t disagreeing," George said, "but maybe most scientists don't care for immortality? Ideas matter more than getting full credit. Alfred Wallace, just as an example.”</p><p>Patrice, who had been half-following the conversation, turned around, her hands on her hips.</p><p>“Great,” she said, “yet another Alfred.”</p><p>“Oh yeah,” George said, “Didn’t even think of that until after I said it. He’s the chap that came up with the idea of evolution concurrently with Darwin. Almost published his work before <em>Orgin</em>, but held off and wound up spending his life in Darwin’s shadow, actually defending Darwin's writing. I think he was happy enough in just knowing the idea got loose and that--”</p><p>“Alfred <em>Wegener</em> risked his life for answers,” Alfred interrupted, “The man went to the Arctic for the sake of science. He got frostbite and cut his toes off with a penknife. When the expedition ran out of food, he killed and ate his sled dogs--"</p><p>"I was wondering about the dog-eating part," George said.</p><p>"--and he eventually died up there in Greenland. He died for <em>science</em>. I want to see him enter the canon for his achievements.”</p><p>“Got nothing to do with him having your name?" Patrice said.</p><p>“Maybe a little,” Albert said, returning to the letter.</p>&#13;</div>&#13; &#13;<div class="footnoteCollection col-xs-12 col-ms-2 col-sm-offset-2 col-sm-8" data-footnote-collection="1">&#13;<ul class="footnotes"></ul>&#13;</div>&#13; &#13; &#13; &#13; &#13;<div class="socialButtons col-xs-12">&#13; <a onclick="window.open('http://twitter.com/share?text=' + encodeURIComponent('Alfreds For Breakfast') + ' %7C A short story by Zachary Bell %7C via @zachary_bell &amp;url=http://bit.ly/1X5jorV', 'windowOpenTab', 'width=600,height=450,left=100, top=100'); return false" href=""><span class="icon-twitter"></span></a>&#13; <a onclick="window.open('http://reddit.com/submit?url=http://www.zacharybell.net/content/2015/08/27/alfreds-for-breakfast.html&amp;title=' + encodeURIComponent('Alfreds For Breakfast'), 'windowOpenTab', 'width=1000,height=600,left=100, top=100'); return false" href=""><span class="icon-reddit"></span></a>&#13; <a onclick="window.open('https://www.facebook.com/dialog/feed?app_id=1175371049143599&amp;display=popup&amp;caption=An%20example%20caption&amp;link=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.facebook.com%2Fdocs%2F&amp;redirect_uri=https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer'&#13;&#10;, 'windowOpenTab', 'width=600,height=600,left=100, top=100'); return false" href=""><span class="icon-facebook"></span></a>&#13; <a onclick="window.location.href = 'mailto:?subject=' + encodeURIComponent('Alfreds For Breakfast') + '%3A%20A%20short%20story%20by%20Zachary%20Bell&amp;body=' + encodeURIComponent('Albert wants to get the man who proposed plate tectonics removed from highschool textbooks.') + '%0A%0A http://bit.ly/1X5jorV'; return false" href=""><span class="icon-mail"></span></a>&#13;</div>&#13; &#13; &#13; &#13; &#13; &#13;</div><div class="row keepReadingWrapper"><div class="col-xs-12 col-ms-offset-1 col-ms-10 col-md-offset-1 col-md-10 keepReading"><h2 class="keepReadingTitle">Keep Reading!</h2><div class="row"><a class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-lg-4 storySummary" href="/content/2015/10/10/the-demonist.html"><div class="coverImage" data-background="http://www.zacharybell.net/images/small/whosblowingwhom.jpg" style="visibility: hidden"></div><div class="details"><h3 class="title">The Demonist</h3><p class="excerpt">Tim buys a book.
